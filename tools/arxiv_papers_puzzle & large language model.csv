2508.10358v1,What to Ask Next? Probing the Imaginative Reasoning of LLMs with TurtleSoup Puzzles,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10358v1,"We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginativereasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses ininformation-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focusedon social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of thisreasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive researchframework based on the classic ""Turtle Soup"" game, integrating a benchmark, anagent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the firstlarge-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expertauthors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop amulti-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capabilitylimits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared tohumans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning andestablishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.",Mengtao Zhou,2025/8/14,2025/8/14,,N/A,['cs.AI']
2508.10142v1,Multi-Turn Puzzles: Evaluating Interactive Reasoning and Strategic Dialogue in LLMs,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10142v1,"Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear andcomplete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments orinteractive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. Thishighlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage inlogically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason withincomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suiteof multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactivedialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministicscoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Ouranalysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuableinsights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed atimproving these critical capabilities.",Kartikeya Badola,2025/8/13,2025/8/13,,N/A,['cs.CL']
2508.01306v1,PUZZLED: Jailbreaking LLMs through Word-Based Puzzles,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01306v1,"As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diversedomains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approachestypically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations ofharmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, anovel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. Itmasks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles forthe LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, andcrossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. Themodel must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed togenerate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluatePUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack successrate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiarpuzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoningcapabilities.",Yelim Ahn,2025/8/2,2025/8/2,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CR']"
2507.17699v1,Thinking Isn't an Illusion: Overcoming the Limitations of Reasoning Models via Tool Augmentations,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17699v1,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's largelanguage model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output astep-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handlecomplex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g.,[Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may notactually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoningactually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, werevisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persistwhen tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools,Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs andtheir LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results showthat, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoningcounterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge therecent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential oftool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.",Zhao Song,2025/7/23,2025/7/23,,N/A,['cs.AI']

Toaddress these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine forAgentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework forDFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agentwith domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematicDFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and errorhandling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure theirdiscussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMScapabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving averageerrors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, weapply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstratingits long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework againreproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally,DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesianensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference atthe Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level.

2507.11932v1,Hyperphantasia: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Mental Visualization Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11932v1,"Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visualrepresentations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays avital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despitethe rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), currentbenchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insightinto the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns tosupport problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skillin humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physicaltrajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginativesimulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a syntheticbenchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMsthrough four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generatedand presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of modelperformance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation ofstate-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance ofhumans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcementlearning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest thatwhile some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.",Mohammad Shahab Sepehri,2025/7/16,2025/7/16,,N/A,['cs.CV']
2507.07313v1,Frontier LLMs Still Struggle with Simple Reasoning Tasks,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07313v1,"While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advancedreasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challengingcompetitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks thatare easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on abroad set of such ""easy"" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in theliterature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, withchangeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in amath problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation requiredto produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. Whileprevious work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to failon such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking modelsconsistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statisticalshortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing longcontexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce theunpuzzles dataset, a different ""easy"" benchmark consisting of trivializedversions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMsexcel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivializedversions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizingthe originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise ableto solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Ourresults highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematicfor frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, evenfor simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily implyimproved performance.",Alan Malek,2025/7/9,2025/7/9,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"

To tackle this challenge, wepropose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generatescounterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes largelanguage models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It thenindependently generates image blocks as ""puzzle pieces"" coherently arrangedaccording to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlledvariations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function thatdifferentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiencyand reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate thatfine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visualreasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results acrossmultiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existingmethods.",Zexi Jia,2025/7/7,2025/7/7,,N/A,['cs.CV']

We introducetextbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose andexplain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure thatreflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points andgenerate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches aredirected towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning providesinsight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Throughthorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethicaldilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, wedemonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) forits task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework forLLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning frameworkto reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks forreasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning usinginverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significantgaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.",Basab Jha,2025/6/30,2025/6/30,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"

While effective at task adaptation, theirimpact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsawpuzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora andsystematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodalmodel, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapidtask acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns moreslowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenonthrough the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correctsamples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training oncorrect RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidlylearning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather thanalgorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlightRFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large languagemodels.",Zhihao Zhang,2025/6/30,2025/6/30,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']"
2506.21734v3,Hierarchical Reasoning Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734v3,"Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented actionsequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer frombrittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrentarchitecture that attains significant computational depth while maintainingboth training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasksin a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediateprocess, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level moduleresponsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achievesexceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 trainingsamples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achievesnearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudokupuzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperformsmuch larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstractionand Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial generalintelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as atransformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purposereasoning systems.",Guan Wang,2025/6/26,2025/8/4,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"

This paper explores the ability of LLMs to playthe 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules byrearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that thisrule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is acompelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompttypes, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual andstructural data from the game. Results show that while larger models(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smallerunadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does notsignificantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even forstate-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes isdifficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). Theresults provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complexproblem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamicallychanging rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.",Fien van Wetten,2025/6/23,2025/6/23,,N/A,['cs.AI']
2506.18485v1,MeRF: Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Reasoning Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18485v1,"Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as apowerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tacklecomplex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of themost distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, asprominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectivelycombined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilitiesof LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced ReinforcementFinetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcementlearning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responseswith awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modificationleverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation withoptimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs fromboth inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knightsand Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistencybetween the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while themodel also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations throughreinforcement learning.",Junjie Zhang,2025/6/23,2025/6/23,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']"

While humans consistently learn to navigate this diversity,large language models (LLMs) struggle with linguistic-mathematical puzzlesinvolving cross-linguistic numeral systems, which humans can learn to solvesuccessfully. We investigate why this task is difficult for LLMs through aseries of experiments that untangle the linguistic and mathematical aspects ofnumbers in language. Our experiments establish that models cannot consistentlysolve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems areexplicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\times$, etc, as in ""twenty +three""). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters ofnumeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use theirlinguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicitcompositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicitnumeral structure. We conclude that the ability to flexibly infer compositionalrules from implicit patterns in human-scale data remains an open challenge forcurrent reasoning models.",Antara Raaghavi Bhattacharya,2025/6/16,2025/6/16,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']"
2506.10887v2,Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887v2,"Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkablyfrom new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In thiswork, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known asout-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications byassociating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments acrossfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization andhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causallyrelated. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, wethen formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show thata one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output andvalue matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combinedweights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Ourtheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to theimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize thenuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structureexplains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with highsample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merelyspurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation forunderstanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing andmitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.",Yixiao Huang,2025/6/12,2025/7/4,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"

By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact withexternal systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received littlesystematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novelbenchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, andguessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios andmeasure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoningchallenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporaryLLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequentlyfail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gaphighlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoningabilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modestgains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodologyfor active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-timefeedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training.

Using areinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binaryfeedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-drivenproblem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantlyimproves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzletraining promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraicmanipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offeringlimited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks.

Although recent foundation models automatethis process, they typically annotate cells independently, without consideringbatch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning.

To mimic this workflow, we introduce theCellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batchof cells.

Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24273v1,"Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectivelyimproved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logicalproblems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates thatRL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought(CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability.However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantlyit contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use,remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate thedynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and SelfReference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as awarm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-startRL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasinglydifficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasetsvarying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conductcontrolled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness(content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longerCoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2)more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbersof backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate throughexperiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by thecorrectness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structuralpatterns over content correctness.

To formalize this process, we introducegenerative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on theCollective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence oflanguage as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internalstates of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates anencoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectivelyencodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLMsubsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrorsthe structure of the original collective representations. This perspectiveprovides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire theircapabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization ofthe Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models andmulti-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs,explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequenceof representation reconstruction.

However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still strugglewith some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solvingjigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability ofvisual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceivedfrom the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning andgenerating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond theperceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversionprocess, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task becauseit repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose anapproach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visualinputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediatevisual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visualmodification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solvetasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting thatclosed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing thevisual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

These phenomena are characterized by certain so-called ""sink tokens""receiving disproportionately high attention weights, exhibiting significantlysmaller value states, and having much larger residual-state norms than those ofother tokens. These extreme tokens give rise to various challenges in LLMinference, quantization, and interpretability.  We elucidate the mechanisms behind extreme-token phenomena. First, we showthat these phenomena arise in very simple architectures -- transformers withone to three layers -- trained on a toy model, the Bigram-Backcopy (BB) task.In this setting, we identify an active-dormant mechanism, where attention headsbecome sinks for specific input domains while remaining non-sinks for others.Our theoretical analysis of the training dynamics reveals that these phenomenaare driven by a mutual reinforcement mechanism. Building on these insights, wepropose strategies to mitigate extreme-token phenomena during pretraining,including replacing softmax with ReLU and Adam with SGD. Next, we extend ouranalysis to pretrained LLMs, including Llama and OLMo, showing that manyattention heads exhibit a similar active-dormant mechanism as in the BB task,and that the mutual reinforcement mechanism also governs the emergence ofextreme-token phenomena during LLM pretraining.

2212.09993v6,Are Deep Neural Networks SMARTer than Second Graders?,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09993v6,"Recent times have witnessed an increasing number of applications of deepneural networks towards solving tasks that require superior cognitiveabilities, e.g., playing Go, generating art, ChatGPT, etc. Such a dramaticprogress raises the question: how generalizable are neural networks in solvingproblems that demand broad skills? To answer this question, we propose SMART: aSimple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task and the associated SMART-101dataset, for evaluating the abstraction, deduction, and generalizationabilities of neural networks in solving visuo-linguistic puzzles designedspecifically for children in the 6--8 age group. Our dataset consists of 101unique puzzles; each puzzle comprises a picture and a question, and theirsolution needs a mix of several elementary skills, including arithmetic,algebra, and spatial reasoning, among others. To scale our dataset towardstraining deep neural networks, we programmatically generate entirely newinstances for each puzzle, while retaining their solution algorithm. Tobenchmark performances on SMART-101, we propose a vision and languagemeta-learning model using varied state-of-the-art backbones. Our experimentsreveal that while powerful deep models offer reasonable performances on puzzlesin a supervised setting, they are not better than random accuracy when analyzedfor generalization. We also evaluate the recent ChatGPT and other largelanguage models on a subset of SMART-101 and find that while these models showconvincing reasoning abilities, the answers are often incorrect.",Anoop Cherian,2022/12/20,2023/9/11,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']"
2212.08681v1,Plansformer: Generating Symbolic Plans using Transformers,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08681v1,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the subject of active research,significantly advancing the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). FromBERT to BLOOM, LLMs have surpassed state-of-the-art results in various naturallanguage tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text generation.Many ongoing efforts focus on understanding LLMs' capabilities, including theirknowledge of the world, syntax, and semantics. However, extending the textualprowess of LLMs to symbolic reasoning has been slow and predominantly focusedon tackling problems related to the mathematical field. In this paper, weexplore the use of LLMs for automated planning - a branch of AI concerned withthe realization of action sequences (plans) to achieve a goal, typicallyexecuted by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned vehicles. Weintroduce Plansformer; an LLM fine-tuned on planning problems and capable ofgenerating plans with favorable behavior in terms of correctness and lengthwith reduced knowledge-engineering efforts. We also demonstrate theadaptability of Plansformer in solving different planning domains with varyingcomplexities, owing to the transfer learning abilities of LLMs. For oneconfiguration of Plansformer, we achieve ~97% valid plans, out of which ~95%are optimal for Towers of Hanoi - a puzzle-solving domain.",Vishal Pallagani,2022/12/16,2022/12/16,,N/A,['cs.AI']
2205.10770v2,Memorization Without Overfitting: Analyzing the Training Dynamics of Large Language Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10770v2,"Despite their wide adoption, the underlying training and memorizationdynamics of very large language models is not well understood. We empiricallystudy exact memorization in causal and masked language modeling, across modelsizes and throughout the training process. We measure the effects of datasetsize, learning rate, and model size on memorization, finding that largerlanguage models memorize training data faster across all settings.Surprisingly, we show that larger models can memorize a larger portion of thedata before over-fitting and tend to forget less throughout the trainingprocess. We also analyze the memorization dynamics of different parts of speechand find that models memorize nouns and numbers first; we hypothesize andprovide empirical evidence that nouns and numbers act as a unique identifierfor memorizing individual training examples. Together, these findings presentanother piece of the broader puzzle of trying to understand what actuallyimproves as models get bigger.",Kushal Tirumala,2022/5/22,2022/11/2,,N/A,['cs.CL']
