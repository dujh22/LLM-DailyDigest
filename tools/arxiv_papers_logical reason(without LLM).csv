2508.06623v1,ContextGuard-LVLM: Enhancing News Veracity through Fine-grained Cross-modal Contextual Consistency Verification,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06623v1,"The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods forverifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency betweenvisual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short inaddressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, andbackground information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advancedVision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextualreasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced oradversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextualmisalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment threeestablished datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with newfine-grained contextual annotations, including ""contextual sentiment,"" ""visualnarrative theme,"" and ""scene-event logical coherence,"" and introduce acomprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-artzero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly allfine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complexlogical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our modelexhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreementrate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacyin discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.",Sihan Ma,2025/8/8,2025/8/8,,,['cs.CV']
2508.04163v1,Generic-to-Specific Reasoning and Learning for Scalable Ad Hoc Teamwork,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04163v1,"AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with otheragents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods consideredstate of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approachthat needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response tochanges. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-makingmakes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveragingthe complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods forreasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, ourarchitecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions throughnon-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specificknowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior ofother agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on genericknowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model.

2507.23541v2,Med-R$^3$: Enhancing Medical Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs via Progressive Reinforcement Learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23541v2,"In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge andleveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancingeither retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, withlittle attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limitedcoordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods relyheavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorizeexisting problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalizationability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while somestudies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in generaldomains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do notadequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address thesechallenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. Inthis framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logicalreasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with thecharacteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilizationthroughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of themodel's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicatethat **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, withLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented withMed-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.",Keer Lu,2025/7/31,2025/8/2,,,['cs.CL']
2507.20999v1,LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999v1,"Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefitsubstantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing theirperformance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameterfine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wiseallocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to differentresponse demands. Inspired by ""Thinking, Fast and Slow,"" which characterizestwo distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) andSystem 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy thatdifferent ""subregions"" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize fortasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-steplogical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA frameworkthat partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, usingfewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify taskdata via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based onimportance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of trainingSystem 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge andintuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) toreinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that thetwo-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage whilematching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.",Yining Huang,2025/7/28,2025/7/28,,,"['cs.LG', 'cs.CL']"

By treatingneural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show thateach layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. Weprove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfullyrepresent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting overcomplex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization andembedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Ourframework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation forunderstanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge.

Although vision language models (VLMs) havedeveloped rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatialreasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatialreasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). Inthe spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generatelocation-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not onlyare the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potentialobjects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textualthinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues anddialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. Toeffectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to theexisting spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labelsresulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format toenhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logicalreasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks ordepth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understandingtasks has significantly improved compared with other models.",Xun Liang,2025/7/28,2025/7/28,,,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
2507.19992v1,NIRS: An Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992v1,"Objective: Develop a Non Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology tosupport knowledge representation in acute care settings.  Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web OntologyLanguage (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts andrelationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchicalstructures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluatedlogical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We usedSPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 dataproperties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. Tostandardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptivedefinitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfullyvalidated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hoursdue to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed theability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapyrecommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework anddemonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patientscenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.",Md Fantacher Islam,2025/7/26,2025/7/26,,,"['q-bio.OT', 'cs.AI']"

However, this training paradigmcannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retrainingto integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles withcertain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integratingneural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neuralsymbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neuralsymbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs andthe capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neuralcomponent, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach torealizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration.

A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17512v1,"Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as apowerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existingresearch has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such asmathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, realworld reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application ofmultiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoningskills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge thisgap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within theRLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematicalreasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct acomprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPOalgorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates themodels' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilitieswhen trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine theintricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emergeduring combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influenceof SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between baseand instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, wedelve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impactsof curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, andlanguage-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offersignificant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealingkey factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoningperformance.

A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate codeexecution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code isoften designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads toover-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoningstructures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs toreason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learningto guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-relatedtasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensiveexperiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, withmodel sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning.

As recent logicalexplorations have shown, its structure exhibits appealing analogies with modallogic. In this paper, we enrich the game with a setting in which players mayhave imperfect information. We propose a new formal framework, Epistemic Logicof Cops and Robbers (ELCR), to make the core notions of the game precise, forinstance, players' positions, observational power and inference. Applying ELCRto analyze the game, we obtain an automated way to track interactions betweenplayers and characterize their information updates during the game. The updatemechanism is defined by a novel dynamic operator, and we compare it with somerelevant paradigms from the game and logic perspectives.

2506.22434v1,MiCo: Multi-image Contrast for Reinforcement Visual Reasoning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22434v1,"This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visualcues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-basedreinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methodstypically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can beparticularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details andcomplex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representationlearning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve assupervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising twoaugmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process tocompare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize themodel with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarityand the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visualchanges and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoningability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relyingon any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significantimprovements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performanceon general vision tasks.",Xi Chen,2025/6/27,2025/6/27,,,['cs.CV']

We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoningcapabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errorsincreasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previouslyunobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we applythe Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework withempirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using theopen-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humanspredictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in generalcapability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of theirincorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends toincrease ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlationbetween model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shiftin error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language modelsnaturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergencetoward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases andlimitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in languagemodel reasoning.",Andrew Keenan Richardson,2025/6/10,2025/6/10,,,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']"

To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment,it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrongprediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassificationdetection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes,i.e., out-of-distribution detection.

However, to solve such complex tasks, existingdeep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematicorganization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, makingit inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) Theycannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities toproduce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, wepropose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR})framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability.Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase topreprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline.Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind ofreasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the aboveframework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledgeorganization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledgeorganization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes,transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, itgenerates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtaindeep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets acrosssix knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover,when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reportswith insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep researchframework.",Zixuan Li,2025/6/7,2025/6/7,,,['cs.AI']

Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of threedifferent model families for different combinations of temporal and geographicknowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involvingonly temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale.However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connectingtemporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations ofperformance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significantperformance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggestingtheir repeated occurrence during model training.

Its original form is intended to a single-winner scenario: exactly one matchis promised.  Its extension to multiple-winner cases employs probabilistic control over  a number of applications of Grover operations, while a no-winner case ishandled by time-out.  Our study explores various schemes of ``eigenmarking'' approach.  Still relying on Grover operations, but the approach introduces additionalqubits  to tag the eigenstates.  The tagged eigenstates are to facilitate an interpretation of the measuredresults and  enhance identification of a no-winner case (related to no logic violation inentailment context).

The results show strong distinguishability in all schemes with the bestrelative distinguishabilities of 19 and 53 in worst case  and in average case, respectively.

The resulting probe canverify intermediate answers with high accuracy and produces highly calibratedscores. Additionally, we find models' hidden states encode correctness offuture answers, enabling early prediction of the correctness before theintermediate answer is fully formulated. We then use the probe as a verifier todecide whether to exit reasoning at intermediate answers during inference,reducing the number of inference tokens by 24\% without compromisingperformance.

However, its efficiency is affected by the transition betweennumerical induction and symbolical deduction, leading to high computationalcosts in the worst-case scenario. Efforts on this issue remain to be limited.In this paper, we identified three reasons why previous optimization algorithmsfor ABL were not effective: insufficient utilization of prediction, symbolrelationships, and accumulated experience in successful abductive processes,resulting in redundant calculations to the knowledge base. To address thesechallenges, we introduce an optimization algorithm named as ProbabilisticSymbol Perception (PSP), which makes a smooth transition between induction anddeduction and keeps the correctness of ABL unchanged.

KRRs can represent complex concepts andrelations, and they can query and manipulate information in sophisticated ways.Unfortunately, the KRR technology has been hindered by the fact that specifyingthe requisite knowledge requires skills that most domain experts do not have,and professional knowledge engineers are hard to find. Some recent CNL-basedapproaches, such as the Knowledge Authoring Logic Machine (KALM), have shown tohave very high accuracy compared to others, and a natural question is to whatextent the CNL restrictions can be lifted. Besides the CNL restrictions, KALMhas limitations in terms of the types of knowledge it can represent. To addressthese issues, we propose an extension of KALM called KALM for Factual Language(KALMF). KALMF uses a neural parser for natural language, MS, to parse what wecall factual English sentences, which require little grammar training to use.Building upon KALMF, we propose KALM for Rules and Actions (KALMR), torepresent and reason with rules and actions. Furthermore, we identify thereasons behind the slow speed of KALM and make optimizations to address thisissue. Our evaluation using multiple benchmarks shows that our approachesachieve a high level of correctness on fact and query authoring (95%) and onrule authoring (100%).

However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats,including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the trainingdata or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing thisthreat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteractpoisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methodspredominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing theunique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we presentFLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federatedlearning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous clientdata and a large number of adversarial participants.

However, currentworks are usually carried out separately on small datasets thus lackinggeneralization ability. Through rigorous evaluation of diverse benchmarks, wedemonstrate the shortcomings of existing ad-hoc methods in achievingcross-domain reasoning and their tendency to data bias fitting. In this paper,we revisit visual reasoning with a two-stage perspective: (1) symbolization and(2) logical reasoning given symbols or their representations. We find that thereasoning stage is better at generalization than symbolization. Thus, it ismore efficient to implement symbolization via separated encoders for differentdata domains while using a shared reasoner. Given our findings, we establishdesign principles for visual reasoning frameworks following the separatedsymbolization and shared reasoning.

To makepartial code (such as code snippets posted on the web or code fragments deepinside complex software projects) executable, the existing study has proposed amachine learning model to predict the undefined element types and inject thepre-defined dummy values into execution. However, the performance of their toolis limited due to its simply designed dummy values and the inability tocontinue learning. In this paper, we design and implement a novel framework,named SelfPiCo (Self Guided Partial Code Executor), to dynamically guidepartial code execution by incorporating the open-source LLM (i.e., Code Llama)within an interactive loop. Particularly, SelfPiCo leverages few-shotin-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to elicit human knowledgeand logical reasoning based on fine-tuning the Code Llama model.

To this end, we propose aneural one-point embedding method called Pathformer based on the tree-likecomputation graph, i.e., query computation tree. Specifically, Pathformerdecomposes the query computation tree into path query sequences by branches andthen uses the transformer encoder to recursively encode these path querysequences to obtain the final query embedding. This allows Pathformer to fullyutilize future context information to explicitly model the complex interactionsbetween various parts of the path query.

The issues of mapping OWL axioms hierarchies and OOP objectshierarchies are due to OWL-based reasoning algorithms, which might change anOWL hierarchy at runtime; instead, OOP hierarchies are usually defined asstatic structures. Although programming paradigms based on reflection allowchanging the OOP hierarchies at runtime and mapping OWL axioms dynamically,there are no currently available mechanisms that do not limit the reasoningalgorithms. Thus, the factory-based paradigm is typically used since itdecouples the OWL and OOP hierarchies. However, the factory inhibits OOPpolymorphism and introduces a paradigm shift with respect to widely acceptedOOP paradigms. We present the OWLOOP API, which exploits the factory to notlimit reasoning algorithms, and it provides novel OOP interfaces concerning theaxioms in an ontology. OWLOOP is designed to limit the paradigm shift requiredfor using ontologies while improving, through OOP-like polymorphism, themodularity of software architectures that exploit logic reasoning.

However, the reasoning process of CoT islinear, step-by-step, similar to personal logical reasoning, suitable forsolving general and slightly complicated problems. On the contrary, thethinking pattern of an expert owns two prominent characteristics that cannot behandled appropriately in CoT, i.e., high-order multi-hop reasoning andmultimodal comparative judgement. Therefore, the core motivation of this paperis transcending CoT to construct a reasoning paradigm that can think like anexpert. The hyperedge of a hypergraph could connect various vertices, making itnaturally suitable for modelling high-order relationships. Inspired by this,this paper innovatively proposes a multimodal Hypergraph-of-Thought (HoT)reasoning paradigm, which enables the foundation models to possess theexpert-level ability of high-order multi-hop reasoning and multimodalcomparative judgement. Specifically, a textual hypergraph-of-thought isconstructed utilizing triple as the primary thought to model higher-orderrelationships, and a hyperedge-of-thought is generated through multi-hopwalking paths to achieve multi-hop inference. Furthermore, we devise a visualhypergraph-of-thought to interact with the textual hypergraph-of-thought viaCross-modal Co-Attention Graph Learning for multimodal comparativeverification.

In this paper we tease these factors apart byleveraging counterfactual conditionals, which force language models to predictunusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions. We introduce a set oftests drawn from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scalecontrolled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from a variety ofpopular pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently ableto override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that thiseffect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge -- however,we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven bysimple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge andlexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, wefind that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though thissensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.",Jiaxuan Li,2022/12/6,2022/12/6,,,['cs.CL']

Spatio-temporalknowledge, however, is required beyond interacting with the physical world, andis also often transferred to the abstract world of concepts through analogiesand metaphors (e.g., ""a threat that is hanging over our heads""). As spatial andtemporal reasoning is ubiquitous, different attempts have been made tointegrate this into AI systems. In the area of knowledge representation,spatial and temporal reasoning has been largely limited to modeling objects andrelations and developing reasoning methods to verify statements about objectsand relations. On the other hand, neural network researchers have tried toteach models to learn spatial relations from data with limited reasoningcapabilities.

Moreover, previous CQA methods can only make predictions for a few giventypes of queries and cannot be flexibly extended to more complex logicalqueries, which significantly limits their applications. To overcome thesechallenges, in this work, we propose a novel N-ary Query Embedding (NQE) modelfor CQA over hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs), which include massiven-ary facts.

While previous NLRmethods can give specific entity-level answers, i.e., ABox answers, they arenot able to provide descriptive concept-level answers, i.e., TBox answers,where each concept is a description of a set of entities.

Insuch cases, models are asked to find probable answers and identify conditionsthat need to be satisfied to make the answers correct. We propose a new model,TReasoner, for this challenging reasoning task. TReasoner consists of anentailment module, a reasoning module, and a generation module (if the answersare free-form text spans).

To this end, we propose RobustLR, a suite ofevaluation datasets that evaluate the robustness of these models to minimallogical edits in rulebases and some standard logical equivalence conditions. Inour experiments with RoBERTa and T5, we find that the models trained in priorworks do not perform consistently on the different perturbations in RobustLR,thus showing that the models are not robust to the proposed logicalperturbations. Further, we find that the models find it especially hard tolearn logical negation and disjunction operators.

Weaddress this issue by introducing a logical reasoning framework for NLI,creating highly transparent model decisions that are based on logical rules.Unlike prior work, we show that improved interpretability can be achievedwithout decreasing the predictive accuracy. We almost fully retain performanceon SNLI, while also identifying the exact hypothesis spans that are responsiblefor each model prediction.

We can further improve model performance and span-leveldecisions by using the e-SNLI explanations during training. Finally, our modelis more robust in a reduced data setting. When training with only 1,000examples, out-of-distribution performance improves on the MNLI matched andmismatched validation sets by 13% and 16% relative to the baseline.

However, there still remainsa challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units.Also, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and furtherfuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the aboveissues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branchgraph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introducedifferent extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logicalunits, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. Thelogical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while thesyntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch.Secondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from eachgraph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The twoadjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformerlayers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous textembedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-awareself-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update thefeatures.

The main idea behind currentapproaches to solving letter-string analogies is to design heuristic rules forextracting analogy structures and constructing analogy mappings. However, onekey problem is that it is difficult to build a comprehensive and exhaustive setof analogy structures which can fully describe the subtlety of analogies. Thisproblem makes current approaches unable to handle complicated letter-stringanalogy problems. In this paper, we propose Neural logic analogy learning(Noan), which is a dynamic neural architecture driven by differentiable logicreasoning to solve analogy problems. Each analogy problem is converted intological expressions consisting of logical variables and basic logicaloperations (AND, OR, and NOT). More specifically, Noan learns the logicalvariables as vector embeddings and learns each logical operation as a neuralmodule. In this way, the model builds computational graph integrating neuralnetwork with logical reasoning to capture the internal logical structure of theinput letter strings. The analogy learning problem then becomes a True/Falseevaluation problem of the logical expressions.

Logical operations are performed in theembedding space by neural operators over the probabilistic embeddings.

2008.09514v1,Neural Logic Reasoning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09514v1,"Recent years have witnessed the success of deep neural networks in manyresearch areas. The fundamental idea behind the design of most neural networksis to learn similarity patterns from data for prediction and inference, whichlacks the ability of cognitive reasoning. However, the concrete ability ofreasoning is critical to many theoretical and practical problems. On the otherhand, traditional symbolic reasoning methods do well in making logicalinference, but they are mostly hard rule-based reasoning, which limits theirgeneralization ability to different tasks since difference tasks may requiredifferent rules. Both reasoning and generalization ability are important forprediction tasks such as recommender systems, where reasoning provides strongconnection between user history and target items for accurate prediction, andgeneralization helps the model to draw a robust user portrait over noisyinputs.  In this paper, we propose Logic-Integrated Neural Network (LINN) to integratethe power of deep learning and logic reasoning. LINN is a dynamic neuralarchitecture that builds the computational graph according to input logicalexpressions. It learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT as neuralmodules, and conducts propositional logical reasoning through the network forinference. Experiments on theoretical task show that LINN achieves significantperformance on solving logical equations and variables. Furthermore, we testour approach on the practical task of recommendation by formulating the taskinto a logical inference problem. Experiments show that LINN significantlyoutperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models in Top-K recommendation,which verifies the potential of LINN in practice.",Shaoyun Shi,2020/8/20,2020/8/20,,,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.IR', 'cs.LO', 'stat.ML']"

There is strategic importance for suchspecifications because, in turn, they enable system model checking to verifythat machine functions taken with user procedures are actually able to achievethese abstract products.

As a first step, weillustrate how graphical class and state diagrams from UML can be developed andcritiqued with subject matter experts to serve as specifications of theconceptual work product of case management.

Our Work Domain Ontology with tools from Semantic Web is needed totranslate UML class and state diagrams for verification of solvability withautomatic reasoning.

Specifically, given training and test sets that contain the same typeof visual reasoning problems, we extract the structural relationships betweenelements in both domains, and enforce them to be as similar as possible withanalogical learning. We repeatedly apply this process with slightly modifiedqueries of the same problem under the assumption that it does not affect therelationship between a training and a test sample. This allows to learn therelational similarity between the two samples in an effective manner even witha single pair of samples. We validate our method on RAVEN dataset, on which itoutperforms state-of-the-art method, with larger gains when the training datais scarce.

As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to keyconcepts of computational thinking provided by: (i) 159 high school studentsenrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems andsimulations. Researchers' reconstructed forma mentis highlighted a positivemindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulationsas ways of discovering nature.
