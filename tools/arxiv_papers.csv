2512.11579v1,Interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling and the origin of the peak-dip-hump structure in the anti-nodal spectrum of high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11579v1,"Electron-phonon coupling is believed to be responsible for many spectral anomalies in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state.",Xinyue Liu,2025/12/12,2025/12/12,,N/A,['cond-mat.str-el']
2512.11025v1,Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11025v1,"A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair""); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.",Hao Geng,2025/12/11,2025/12/11,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'hep-ph']"
2512.10941v1,Mull-Tokens: Modality-Agnostic Latent Thinking,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10941v1,"Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.",Arijit Ray,2025/12/11,2025/12/11,,N/A,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"
2512.10834v1,Allometric scaling of brain activity explained by avalanche criticality,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10834v1,"Allometric scaling laws, such as Kleiber's law for metabolic rate, highlight how efficiency emerges with size across living systems. The brain, with its characteristic sublinear scaling of activity, has long posed a puzzle: why do larger brains operate with disproportionately lower firing rates? Here we show that this economy of scale is a universal outcome of avalanche dynamics. We derive analytical scaling laws directly from avalanche statistics, establishing that any system governed by critical avalanches must exhibit sublinear activity-size relations. This theoretical prediction is then verified in integrate-and-fire neuronal networks at criticality and in classical self-organized criticality models, demonstrating that the effect is not model-specific but generic. The predicted exponents align with experimental observations across mammal species, bridging dynamical criticality with the allometry of brain metabolism. Our results reveal avalanche criticality as a fundamental mechanism underlying Kleiber-like scaling in the brain.",Tiago S. A. N. Simões,2025/12/11,2025/12/11,,N/A,['q-bio.NC']
2512.10525v1,Parallel Neuron Groups in the Drosophila Brain,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10525v1,"The full connectome of an adult Drosophila enables a search for novel neural structures in the insect brain. I describe a new neural structure, called a Parallel Neuron Group (PNG). Two neurons are called parallel if they share a significant number of input neurons and output neurons. Most pairs of neurons in the Drosophila brain have very small parallel match. There are about twenty larger groups of neurons for which any pair of neurons in the group has a high match. These are the parallel groups. Parallel groups contain only about 1000 out of the 65,000 neurons in the brain, and have distinctive properties. There are groups in the right mushroom bodies, the antennal lobes, the lobula, and in two central neuropils (GNG and EB). Most parallel groups do not have lateral symmetry. A group usually has one major input neuron, which inputs to all the neurons in the group, and a small number of major output neurons. The major input and output neurons are laterally asymmetric. Parallel neuron groups present puzzles, such as: what does a group do, that could not be done by one larger neuron? Do all neurons in a group fire in synchrony, or do they perform different functions? Why are they laterally asymmetric? These may merit further investigation.",Robert Worden,2025/12/11,2025/12/11,,N/A,['q-bio.NC']
2512.10021v1,Corkscrew motion of Trypanosome brucei is driven by helical beating of the flagellum and facilitated by its bent shape,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10021v1,"In the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a laterally attached flagellum drives rapid deformation of the complex cell body, producing puzzling dynamics. High-speed defocusing imaging reveals that surface points trace flower-like patterns in transverse planes. The petals arise from clockwise flagellar beating, which generates a right-handed helical wave propagating from the anterior tip along the body, advancing the cell like a twisted corkscrew. The central lobes result from slower counterclockwise body rotation required to balance the active torque. The bent cell shape underneath the flagellum superimposes these two chiral motions at different radial distances, producing the observed patterns. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the method of regularized Stokeslets reproduce these dynamics and show that bent cell shape enhances swimming, suggesting an adaptive advantage of T. brucei's morphology.",Sizhe Cheng,2025/12/10,2025/12/10,,N/A,"['physics.bio-ph', 'cond-mat.soft', 'physics.flu-dyn']"
2512.09980v1,UV Luminosity Functions from HST and JWST: A Possible Resolution to the High-Redshift Galaxy Abundance Puzzle and Implications for Cosmic Strings,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09980v1,"Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $Gμ\lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.",Mattéo Blamart,2025/12/10,2025/12/10,,N/A,"['astro-ph.CO', 'astro-ph.GA', 'gr-qc', 'hep-ph', 'hep-th']"
2512.09761v2,Prefrontal scaling of reward prediction error readout gates reinforcement-derived adaptive behavior in primates,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09761v2,"Reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive behavior across species via reward prediction errors (RPEs), but the neural origins of species-specific adaptability remain unknown. Integrating RL modeling, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging during reversal learning, we discovered convergent RPE signatures - shared monoaminergic/synaptic gene upregulation and neuroanatomical representations, yet humans outperformed macaques behaviorally. Single-trial decoding showed RPEs guided choices similarly in both species, but humans disproportionately recruited dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Cross-species alignment uncovered that macaque prefrontal circuits encode human-like optimal RPEs yet fail to translate them into action. Adaptability scaled not with RPE encoding fidelity, but with the areal extent of dACC/dlPFC recruitment governing RPE-to-action transformation. These findings resolve an evolutionary puzzle: behavioral performance gaps arise from executive cortical readout efficiency, not encoding capacity.",Tian Sang,2025/12/10,2025/12/11,,N/A,['q-bio.NC']
2512.09256v1,Observation of ubiquitous charge correlations and hidden quantum critical point in hole-doped kagome superconductors,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09256v1,"The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches.",Ilija K. Nikolov,2025/12/10,2025/12/10,,N/A,['cond-mat.str-el']
2512.09195v1,Finite $V_{\rm 2Δ}$ puzzle in low-multiplicity pp collisions from ultra-long-range azimuthal correlations in the string-shoving model,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09195v1,"Ultra-long range angular correlations have been recently reported by the ALICE collaboration in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV below ${\rm d}N_{\rm ch}/{\rm d}η=7$. The measurements have been performed as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity at midrapidity ($N_{\rm ch}$ in $|η|<0.8$), which is known to be strongly sensitive to local multiplicity fluctuations. The present work investigates the impact of the event-activity estimator on ultra-long range angular correlations. The study is conducted in the framework of PYTHIA8 with the string shoving mechanism since it gives a non-zero elliptic flow coefficient, $V_{2Δ}$. The analysis is conducted as a function of $N_{\rm ch}$, the number of parton-parton scatterings ($N_{\rm mpi}$) and flattenicity. Surprisingly, for ultra-long range correlations, pp collisions with $N_{\rm mpi}=1$ (dijets) seems to be the most sensitive to string shoving. The effect diminishes with increasing $N_{\rm mpi}$. While in data, within uncertainties, $V_{2Δ}$ exhibits a weak multiplicity dependence; the string shoving mechanism gives a $V_{2Δ}$ that decreases with the increase in $N_{\rm ch}$. The present work therefore supports the picture stating that mechanisms such as string shoving might explain the low multiplicity limit, whereas, hydro becomes relevant in high-multiplicity pp collisions. This work also suggests that flattenicity might be more effective than $N_{\rm ch}$ to better handle non-flow effects.",Antonio Ortiz,2025/12/9,2025/12/9,,N/A,['hep-ph']
2512.08918v1,Improved Pseudorandom Codes from Permuted Puzzles,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08918v1,"Watermarks are an essential tool for identifying AI-generated content. Recently, Christ and Gunn (CRYPTO '24) introduced pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRCs), which are equivalent to watermarks with strong robustness and quality guarantees. A PRC is a pseudorandom encryption scheme whose decryption algorithm tolerates a high rate of errors. Pseudorandomness ensures quality preservation of the watermark, and error tolerance of decryption translates to the watermark's ability to withstand modification of the content.  In the short time since the introduction of PRCs, several works (NeurIPS '24, RANDOM '25, STOC '25) have proposed new constructions. Curiously, all of these constructions are vulnerable to quasipolynomial-time distinguishing attacks. Furthermore, all lack robustness to edits over a constant-sized alphabet, which is necessary for a meaningfully robust LLM watermark. Lastly, they lack robustness to adversaries who know the watermarking detection key. Until now, it was not clear whether any of these properties was achievable individually, let alone together.  We construct pseudorandom codes that achieve all of the above: plausible subexponential pseudorandomness security, robustness to worst-case edits over a binary alphabet, and robustness against even computationally unbounded adversaries that have the detection key. Pseudorandomness rests on a new assumption that we formalize, the permuted codes conjecture, which states that a distribution of permuted noisy codewords is pseudorandom. We show that this conjecture is implied by the permuted puzzles conjecture used previously to construct doubly efficient private information retrieval. To give further evidence, we show that the conjecture holds against a broad class of simple distinguishers, including read-once branching programs.",Miranda Christ,2025/12/9,2025/12/9,,N/A,['cs.CR']
2512.08834v1,The Strong-$CP$ Problem and its Gauge Axion solution as Evidence for Fundamental Strings,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08834v1,"The topological susceptibility of the QCD vacuum provides an understanding of $θ$-vacua as vacua of a Chern-Simons gauge theory. In this way, it gives an immediate proof of the physicality of the boundary $θ$-term. This makes the essence of the strong-$CP$ puzzle very transparent and offers a solution in form of the gauge axion, which has exact quality. This axion represents an intrinsic part of the QCD gauge redundancy without any reference to an anomalous global symmetry. It is a two-form transforming under the QCD gauge symmetry. Due to its pure gauge nature, the gauge axion represents a powerful tool to monitor physics of $θ$-vacua in various regimes. Unlike the ordinary Peccei-Quinn axion, which is UV-completed into a Goldstone phase of a complex scalar and thereby suffers from the quality problem, the gauge axion is UV-completed directly into a fundamental theory of gravity. We study the domain wall and string structure of the gauge axion and show that the strings sourcing it must be a part of this fundamental theory. We thus observe that the absence of the axion quality problem motivates the presence of fundamental strings. This provides a new argument for a connection between the axion and gravity.",Gia Dvali,2025/12/9,2025/12/9,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'astro-ph.CO', 'hep-ph']"
2512.08801v1,Exact $S$-duality Map for Rigid Surface Operators,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08801v1,"Surface operators in four-dimensional gauge theories are two-dimensional defects, serving as natural generalizations of Wilson lines and 't Hooft line operators. They act as ideal probes for exploring the non-perturbative structure of the theory. Rigid surface operators are a specific class of surface operators characterized by the absence of continuous deformation parameters. It is expected that a closed $S$-duality map should exist among these rigid operators. While progress has been made on specific examples or subclasses by leveraging invariants and empirical conjectures, a complete picture remains elusive.  A significant challenge arises when multiple rigid surface operators share identical invariants, making the determination of $S$-duality relations difficult. More critically, a mismatch exists in the number of rigid surface operators between dual theories when classified by invariants; this is referred to as the \textit{mismatch problem}. This discrepancy suggests the necessity of extending the scope of consideration beyond strictly rigid operators.  In this paper, we propose a direct, natural, and precise $S$-duality map for rigid surface operators.  Our map is realized by moving the longest row in the pair of partitions defining a surface operator from one factor to the other, with an additional box appended or deleted to balance the total number of boxes.  This mapping naturally incorporates non-rigid surface operators, thereby resolving the mismatch problem. The proposed map is applicable to gauge groups of all ranks and clarifies several long-standing puzzles in the field.",Chuanzhong Li,2025/12/9,2025/12/9,,N/A,['hep-th']
2512.08553v1,"Supercritical-subcritical correspondence, asymmetric effects and antisymmetric corrections near a critical point",http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08553v1,"The second-order phase transitions in the Ising model and liquid-gas systems share a universality class and critical exponents, despite the absence of $Z_2$ symmetry in the liquid-gas Hamiltonian. This discrepancy highlights a central puzzle in critical phenomena: what is the influence of asymmetry on scaling laws? For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\pm$ lines). Our theory predicts that the linear mixing of physical fields - a hallmark of asymmetric systems - produces universal scaling corrections, with antisymmetric coefficients, in these supercritical loci. We verify these predictions using liquid-gas data from the NIST database and a model liquid-liquid transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same asymmetric scaling framework governs the behavior of higher-order cumulants in the order parameter distribution.",Xinyang Li,2025/12/9,2025/12/9,,N/A,['cond-mat.stat-mech']
2512.07526v1,The Suicide Region: Option Games and the Race to Artificial General Intelligence,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07526v1,"Standard real options theory predicts delay in exercising the option to invest or deploy when extreme asset volatility or technological uncertainty are present. However, in the current race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), sovereign actors are exhibiting behaviors contrary to theoretical predictions: the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite acknowledging the potential for catastrophic failure from AGI misalignment. We resolve this puzzle by formalizing the AGI race as a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk. In our model, the cost of failure is no longer bounded only by the sunk cost of investment (I), but rather a systemic ruin parameter (D) that is correlated with development velocity and shared globally. As the disutility of catastrophe is embedded in both players' payoffs, the risk term mathematically cancels out of the equilibrium indifference condition. This creates a ""suicide region"" in the investment space where competitive pressures force rational agents to deploy AGI systems early, despite a negative risk-adjusted net present value. Furthermore, we show that ""warning shots"" (sub-existential disasters) will fail to deter AGI acceleration, as the winner-takes-all nature of the race remains intact. The race can only be halted if the cost of ruin is internalized, making safety research a prerequisite for economic viability. We derive the critical private liability threshold required to restore the option value of waiting and propose mechanism design interventions that can better ensure safe AGI research and socially responsible deployment.",David Tan,2025/12/8,2025/12/8,,N/A,"['q-fin.RM', 'econ.GN', 'q-fin.GN']"
2512.07217v1,Microscopic signatures of Chern number sign reversal in twisted bilayer WSe2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07217v1,"The discovery of quantized Chern numbers in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers,including 3.7{deg} twisted MoTe2 and 1.23{deg} twisted WSe2,has emerged as a defining breakthrough in physics. A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12.",Ke Lv,2025/12/8,2025/12/8,,N/A,"['cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.str-el']"
2512.07185v1,"Facilitating Conditions as an Enabler, Not a Direct Motivator: A Robustness and Mediation Analysis of E-Learning Adoption",http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07185v1,"Despite substantial institutional investment in e-learning infrastructure, student engagement often fails to meet expectations--a persistent paradox that challenges the established direct relationship between Facilitating Conditions (FC) and behavioral intention within the classic UTAUT framework. To resolve this theoretical puzzle, we reconceptualized the role of FC through an empirical study of 470 Indonesian university students. Our robust, multi-stage analytical approach first confirmed the significant influence of established drivers--Performance Expectancy (beta=0.190), Effort Expectancy (beta=0.198), Social Influence (beta=0.151), and Perceived Enjoyment (beta=0.472)--on Behavioral Intention (BI), which in turn strongly predicted Use Behavior (beta=0.666). Crucially, however, the direct effect of FC on BI proved non-significant (beta=-0.085). A subsequent mediation model revealed FC's true function as a foundational enabling construct that operates indirectly by powerfully enhancing both Performance Expectancy (beta=0.556) and Effort Expectancy (beta=0.419). Our findings demonstrate that the value of technological infrastructure lies not in its mere presence, but in its dynamic capacity to enable learning and optimize user experience.

It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space.

2512.06554v1,On the determination of the proton electromagnetic form factors from the DVCS measurements,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06554v1,"We present a detailed analysis of the proton electromagnetic form factors (FFs) using exclusive photon leptoproduction (EP) data in kinematic regions where the Bethe-Heitler (BH) contribution dominates the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) cross section. By exploiting the strong sensitivity of the BH amplitude to the Dirac and Pauli FFs, we determine $F_{1}(t)$, $F_{2}(t)$ and the corresponding Sachs FFs from several fitting scenarios based on dipole and $ P $-pole parametrizations, and evaluate the charge and magnetic radii of the proton. We show that EP measurements in the range $ 0.11 < |t| < 0.45 $ GeV$ ^2 $ provide meaningful constraints on $F_{1}(t)$, while offering limited sensitivity to $F_{2}(t)$. Our results systematically favor smaller charge radius values compared with those from traditional elastic electron-proton scattering measurements, consistent with recent high-precision PRad measurements. This study demonstrates that EP measurements, especially when covering smaller values of $|t|$, can serve as a complementary and powerful tool for determining the proton electromagnetic structure and may offer additional insight into the long-standing charge-radius puzzle.

To counter this, we introduce CompressARC, a 76K parameter model without any pretraining that solves 20% of evaluation puzzles by minimizing the description length (MDL) of the target puzzle purely during inference time. The MDL endows CompressARC with extreme generalization abilities typically unheard of in deep learning. To our knowledge, CompressARC is the only deep learning method for ARC-AGI where training happens only on a single sample: the target inference puzzle itself, with the final solution information removed. Moreover, CompressARC does not train on the pre-provided ARC-AGI ""training set"". Under these extremely data-limited conditions, we do not ordinarily expect any puzzles to be solvable at all. Yet CompressARC still solves a diverse distribution of creative ARC-AGI puzzles, suggesting MDL to be an alternative feasible way to produce intelligence, besides conventional pretraining.",Isaac Liao,2025/12/5,2025/12/5,,N/A,['cs.LG']

The magnitude and consistency of the DM evolution, along with a high host DM contribution, strongly indicate that the source resides in a dense, expanding ionized medium, likely a young supernova remnant (SNR).",Chen-Hui Niu,2025/12/5,2025/12/5,,N/A,['astro-ph.HE']

This paper offers a novel framework by conceptualizing the globalized economy as a ""Congestible Club Good,"" leading to a ""Fractured Metropolis."" We argue that globalization flows ($M$) are constrained by domestic Institutional Capacity ($K$), which is heterogeneous and historically contingent. We introduce the concept of the ""Optimization Cutoff"": globalization incentivized the US to bypass costly domestic upgrades in favor of global expansion, leading to the long-term neglect of Public Capacity ($K_{Public}$). This historical path created a deep polarization. ""Congested Incumbents,"" reliant on the stagnant $K_{Public}$, experience globalization as chaos ($MC>MB$), while ""Insulated Elites"" use Private Capacity ($K_{Private}$) to bypass bottlenecks ($MB>MC$). This divergence paralyzes the consensus needed to restore $K_{Public}$, creating a ""Capacity Trap"" where protectionism becomes the politically rational, yet economically suboptimal, equilibrium. Empirically, we construct an Institutional Congestion Index using textual analysis (2000-2024), revealing an exponential surge in disorder-related keywords (from 272 hits to 1,333). We triangulate this perception with the material failure of $K_{Public}$, such as the 3.7 million case backlog in US immigration courts.

2512.04208v1,A Black-Hole Envelope Interpretation for Cosmological Demographics of Little Red Dots,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04208v1,"Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0<z<5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000~\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $\gtrsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z<5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.",Hiroya Umeda,2025/12/3,2025/12/3,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']
2512.04166v1,JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166v1,"We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$α$, [NII]/H$α$, [SII]/H$α$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.",Pieter van Dokkum,2025/12/3,2025/12/3,,N/A,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.CO', 'astro-ph.HE']"

We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.",Hong Yang,2025/12/3,2025/12/3,,N/A,['cs.LG']

Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance. These findings show that even in simple cooperative tasks, LLM communication strategies diverge and depend on the granularity of feedback signals. AsymPuzl thus provides a testbed for probing the limits of multi-turn cooperation and opens avenues for studying coordination mechanisms.",Xavier Cadet,2025/12/3,2025/12/3,,N/A,"['cs.MA', 'cs.AI']"

Here, we uncover a Z_2 topological bipolar skin effect in a non-Hermitian Rashba chain, where spin-up and spin-down eigenstates localize at opposite boundaries. By strictly computing the Lyapunov exponents and introducing a biorthogonal spin-separation index, we map the global phase diagram and reveal a hierarchical breakdown of topology. We demonstrate that the Z_2 skin effect is protected against moderate disorder but collapses into a trivial skin phase before the ultimate onset of Anderson localization.

In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.

These clear signs of BSM physics motivate extensions introducing new particles and symmetries. Theoretical questions like the flavor puzzle and the strong CP problem further guide BSM frameworks. This thesis explores BSM scenarios based on two guiding principles: constructing unified frameworks that address multiple open problems in (astro)particle physics and cosmology, and emphasizing their experimental testability through detailed phenomenological analyses. This approach uncovers deep connections between seemingly disconnected sectors, offering a more complete view of fundamental physics. We investigate dark sector models for the origin of neutrino masses, proposing a novel setup: dark linear seesaw, which radiatively links neutrino mass generation to DM candidates and predicts charged lepton flavor violation. In these scenarios, dark sector particles can constitute WIMP DM, testable via direct detection experiments. We study spontaneous CP violation induced by a complex scalar singlet, acting as a common origin of low- and high-energy CP violating effects relevant for leptogenesis. We also analyze a Nelson-Barr model that solves the strong CP problem, generates a realistic CKM matrix radiatively, and yields scalar WIMP DM. Additionally, we present unified axion frameworks in which a colored sector radiatively generates neutrino masses. These models predict distinctive axion couplings to photons and fermions and accommodate axion DM in both pre- and post-inflationary cosmologies.

By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude.

The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \frac{2}{ π} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $ζ$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b.

In principle, it facilitates direct connections between nuclear data and the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Although in practice traditional nuclear EDF theory has strained to describe finite nuclei and infinite systems at the same time, recently developed extended EDF models overcome many of the limitations of traditional models in that respect. A recent challenge to EDF and EoS studies has come entirely from within nuclear structure, namely how to account both for the relatively thin neutron skin in 48Ca as extracted by the CREX experiment and the relatively thick neutron skin of 208Pb exctracted by the PREX-II experiment. The discrepancy suggests a surface and structure effect. The present study shows that the puzzle can be resolved in a non-relativistic framework by revisiting the nuclear surface tension and diffuseness, as driven in part by the EoS in dilute matter well below the saturation point and in part by the isovector gradient terms and spin-orbit potential. Such effects have no bearing on the EoS near and above saturation.",Panagiota Papakonstantinou,2025/11/27,2025/11/27,,N/A,['nucl-th']

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.",Charles Schepanowski,2025/11/26,2025/11/26,,N/A,['cs.AI']

The crux of the argument is to understand Lewisian common knowledge as an account of what it means for an event to be public. We first formulate this argument informally to clarify its philosophical commitment and then propose one way to capture it formally in epistemic-plausibility models.

XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}=10^{42.31\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date.

Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (""data"", ""poop"", ""loll"": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate).

Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate.",Takato Mori,2025/11/25,2025/11/25,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'quant-ph']"

Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions.",Johannes Kerber,2025/11/25,2025/11/25,,N/A,"['quant-ph', 'physics.optics']"

By employing the flavor SU(3) symmetry and its breaking effect, the parameters describing soft contributions are correlated and subsequently reduced into a more concise set of SU(3) parameters. Through a $χ^2$ analysis procedure applied to the experimental data, these parameters are determined, for which the corresponding theoretical results for the branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries in $B\to PV$ decays are derived. Within this framework, it is demonstrated that the theoretical calculations align well with experimental measurements, thereby offering a solution to several long-standing puzzles.

The model contains a Dirac DM particle $χ$, three heavy neutrinos $N_I$ with masses $M_{N,I}$, and a singlet scalar $R$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $Φ$ by an angle $α$. A symmetry forbids the $Φ$-$R$ portal at tree level; the leading portal then arises at one loop from the same Yukawa structures that generate active neutrino masses $m_{ν,I}$, implying $\tan(2α) \propto \sum_I m_{ν,I} M^2_{N,I}/(v_h m_H^2)$, where $v_h$ and $m_H$ are the SM Higgs VEV and mass. For heavy-neutrino masses in the multi-TeV range, this yields a naturally tiny mixing, $\tan(2α)\sim 5\times 10^{-11}\left(M_N/10~\mathrm{TeV}\right)^2$, which strongly suppresses DM signals in direct, indirect, and collider searches. For PeV-scale heavy neutrinos the DM-nucleon cross section can instead enter the reach of direct-detection experiments. The visible and dark sectors thermalize at temperatures of order a few times the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino, then subsequently decouple, and typically evolve with a slightly hotter dark bath. In the secluded regime, with $\tan(2α)\ll 1$ and $m_χ>m_{H_p}$, the relic density is set by $p$-wave annihilation $χ\barχ\to H_p H_p$ (with $H_p$ the Higgs-like particle of the dark sector), and the dark-sector Yukawa couplings required to reproduce the observed abundance are $\sim(0.1\text{-}1)$, as in the standard WIMP case. For heavy-neutrino masses $\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{TeV}$, the mediator decays before nucleosynthesis without spoiling BBN observables, while the tiny portal suppresses present-day signals below current and near-future sensitivities.

Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointed close to our line of sight, offer a unique view into jet dynamics. Blazar $γ$-ray light curves exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flares that point to promising alternative dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection. This study uses three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations with the PLUTO code to explore magnetic reconnection in turbulent, magnetized plasma columns. Focusing on current-driven kink instabilities, we identify the formation of current sheets due to magnetic reconnection, leading to plasmoid formation. We develop a novel technique combining hierarchical structure analysis and reconnection diagnostics to identify reconnecting current sheets. A statistical analysis of their geometry and orientation reveals a smaller subset that aligns closely with the jet axis, consistent with the jet-in-jet model. These structures can generate relativistically moving plasmoids with significant Doppler boosting, offering a plausible mechanism for the fast flares superimposed on slowly varying blazar light curves.

Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models.

We develop a unified computational framework (DP + Monte Carlo) that introduces Cognitive Heterogeneity across classes. Our Hybrid Model (M-H) posits that the poor act as ""Rational Survivors"" (M1 utility, Reality parameters), while the middle/rich act as ""Biased Strivers"" (M4b utility, Belief parameters).  Our simulations yield three core findings. First, we confirm that the ""Survival"" strategy is objectively rational whenever risk exceeds a low threshold ($σ> 0.45$). Given that real-world risk is massive ($σ_{Real} \approx 4.9$), the modern ""Quality"" strategy is objectively fragile. Second, the trap for the Middle/Rich ($B \ge 200$) is driven by a ""Two-Stage Belief Error"": they are first ""baited"" by a Causal Error (underestimating risk) to enter the status game, and then ""trapped"" by a Marginal Error (underestimating returns) which triggers a stop in fertility. Third, the U-shape is driven by the cognitive divide. The Poor escape the trap by retaining a ""Rational Survival"" strategy in the face of real high risk. Conversely, the Aspirational Middle Class ($HC \approx 12, B \ge 200$) is uniquely trapped by their Biased Beliefs.

While $Λ$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $Λ$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $Λ$CDM cosmology.

We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification.

However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases.

Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33\% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models.

Motivated by microscopic calculations showing density- and isospin-asymmetry-dependence of self-energies, we implement a new form for the baryon-meson couplings. The parameters for the couplings are constrained by a Bayesian analysis, which anchors the model to nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($χ$EFT) predictions for pure neutron matter, heavy-ion collision data, and HALQCD-based hyperon potential calculations at 3-momentum $|\mathbf{k}|=0$ in both isospin-symmetric and pure neutron matter. The resulting EoS satisfies neutron star mass-radius constraints from NICER and GW170817, providing another way to address the hyperon puzzle.

Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called $ν$HDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the $ν$HDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the $ν$HDM model was proven capable of reproducing the $Λ$CDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history ($Ω_m \approx$ 0.3 and $H_0 \approx$ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the $ν$HDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-$ν$HDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by \textit{Planck}, except its fourth peak, but the opt-$ν$HDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with $Ω_m \approx$ 0.5 and $H_0 \approx$ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-$ν$HDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the $ν$HDM model, as well as in the opt-$ν$HDM model occurs quiet late, at $z\approx4$ and at $z\approx 5.5$, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the $ν$HDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.",Nikolaos Samaras,2025/11/19,2025/11/19,,N/A,['astro-ph.CO']

In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a ""canvas"" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training.

This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation.

Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{μν}\Box^{-2}R_{μν}$, $R^{μνσδ}\Box^{-2}R_{μνσδ}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{ΛCDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons.

2511.12738v1,Direct Visual Grounding by Directing Attention of Visual Tokens,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12738v1,"Vision Language Models (VLMs) mix visual tokens and text tokens. A puzzling issue is the fact that visual tokens most related to the query receive little to no attention in the final layers of the LLM module of VLMs from the answer tokens, where all tokens are treated equally, in particular, visual and language tokens in the LLM attention layers. This fact may result in wrong answers to visual questions, as our experimental results confirm. It appears that the standard next-token prediction (NTP) loss provides an insufficient signal for directing attention to visual tokens. We hypothesize that a more direct supervision of the attention of visual tokens to corresponding language tokens in the LLM module of VLMs will lead to improved performance on visual tasks. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we propose a novel loss function that directly supervises the attention of visual tokens. It directly grounds the answer language tokens in images by directing their attention to the relevant visual tokens. This is achieved by aligning the attention distribution of visual tokens to ground truth attention maps with KL divergence. The ground truth attention maps are obtained from task geometry in synthetic cases or from standard grounding annotations (e.g., bounding boxes or point annotations) in real images, and are used inside the LLM for attention supervision without requiring new labels. The obtained KL attention loss (KLAL) when combined with NTP encourages VLMs to attend to relevant visual tokens while generating answer tokens. This results in notable improvements across geometric tasks, pointing, and referring expression comprehension on both synthetic and real-world data, as demonstrated by our experiments. We also introduce a new dataset to evaluate the line tracing abilities of VLMs. Surprisingly, even commercial VLMs do not perform well on this task.",Parsa Esmaeilkhani,2025/11/16,2025/11/16,,N/A,['cs.CV']

Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$λ$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $λ$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.",Mohamad Amin Mohamadi,2025/11/14,2025/11/21,,N/A,['cs.LG']

Even though the charged particle is not allowed to interact with the magnetic field, it accumulates a phase shift that affects the interference pattern produced. Not surprisingly, this apparent nonlocality is puzzling and counter intuitive. In this work, we provide an explanation that explains the physics underlying this apparent nonlocality. We find that the role of the confined magnetic field is to impart a puncture in the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2$, of the charge. Therefore, the quantum state corresponding to the charged quantum particle acquires the phase shift due to its response to the modified topology of the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, corresponding to the charge.",Manvendra Somvanshi,2025/11/14,2025/11/14,,N/A,"['quant-ph', 'hep-th', 'math-ph']"

Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel ""stripe-type orthorhombic phase"" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation.

Two-particle correlation functions are provided, along with $Δy$ and $Δ\varphi$ projections, and are compared to Monte Carlo (MC) model predictions. For the first time, the measurement is performed as a function of the event's charged-particle density. The shapes of the correlation functions are studied in detail for each particle pair.

In this work, an additional approach is introduced to study the multiplicity dependence of the correlation functions in more detail and reveal qualitative differences in the underlying sources of correlations, such as quantum statistics, final-state interactions, and resonance decays. The puzzling near-side anticorrelation in baryon-baryon measurements is observed across all multiplicity classes and remains a challenge for models of particle production in pp collisions. Furthermore, the multiplicity dependence of the correlations between mesons provides an independent means to explore the sensitivity of current MC models to soft-QCD effects and hadronization dynamics.

These findings suggest that the physical mechanism driving the explosion of massive stars manifests a well-defined axial symmetry and acts on large scales.",Yi Yang,2025/11/11,2025/11/11,,N/A,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.HE']"
2511.08715v1,Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715v1,"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.",Connar Hite,2025/11/11,2025/11/11,,N/A,['cs.AI']
2511.08702v1,FAIRPLAI: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach to Fair and Private Machine Learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08702v1,"As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

To support this claim, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum $O(n)$ models on a lattice. In doing so, we also revisit two puzzling results in the literature on quantum $O(n)$ models, concerning universal scaling and equilibration, and demonstrate how these apparent contradictions can be resolved by properly accounting for lattice effects.",Guido Giachetti,2025/11/11,2025/11/11,,N/A,"['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'quant-ph']"

Over the past decade or so, there has been increasing evidence from lattice calculations that the worldsheet theories of such QCD strings contain a massive pseudoscalar (axion), at least when $N\geq 3$. This has so far been puzzling from the perspective of holographic realizations of strings in confining gauge theories. In this note, we will show how such axions appear naturally in the realization of 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) from $M$-theory spacetimes in which the extra dimensions are modeled by certain complete metrics of $G_2$-holonomy. This picture predicts that QCD string axions exist only if the gauge group is $SU(N\geq 3)$, $SO(4N+2)$, or $E_6$ (or a quotient/double-cover thereof), and is absent from the spectrum of stable QCD strings if the gauge group is $SU(2)$, $SO(2N+1)$, $SO(4N)$, $Sp(N)$, or $E_7$. We argue why we expect this pattern to persist for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills strings, at least for large $N$, something which could be tested in future lattice studies of QCD strings for gauge algebras of B, C, D, and E-type.",Bobby Samir Acharya,2025/11/11,2025/11/11,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'hep-lat', 'hep-ph']"

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps.

A Controlled Study of Multi-Agent Debate in Logical Reasoning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07784v1,"Multi-agent debate (MAD) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). Yet, whether LLM agents can genuinely engage in deliberative reasoning, beyond simple ensembling or majority voting, remains unclear. We address this question through a controlled study using the Knight--Knave--Spy logic puzzle, which enables precise, step-wise evaluation of debate outcomes and processes under verifiable ground truth. We systematically set up six structural and cognitive factors, including agent team size, composition, confidence visibility, debate order, debate depth, and task difficulty, to disentangle their respective effects on collective reasoning. Our results show that intrinsic reasoning strength and group diversity are the dominant drivers of debate success, while structural parameters such as order or confidence visibility offer limited gains. Beyond outcomes, process-level analyses identify key behavioral patterns: majority pressure suppresses independent correction, effective teams overturn incorrect consensus, and rational, validity-aligned reasoning most strongly predicts improvement. These findings provide valuable insights into how and why LLM debates succeed or fail, offering guidance for designing interpretable and truth-seeking multi-agent reasoning systems.",Haolun Wu,2025/11/11,2025/11/11,,N/A,['cs.MA']

Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.",Xin Qiu,2025/11/10,2025/11/10,,N/A,"['cs.LG', 'cs.CL']"

Treated as ""blind"" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods.

To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations.

Conventional smoothing methods, which are required to process these data, often distort the curvature-based criteria used for matching and cause a loss of critical information. This paper proposes a method to overcome these issues, demonstrated on the automatic reconstruction of a 54-piece puzzle.  We reconstruct each piece's contour using a novel corotational beam spline, which models the boundary as a flexible beam with compliant spring supports at the measured data points. A distinctive feature is the dynamic re-indexing of these points; as their calculated positions are refined, they are re-numbered based on their projection onto the computed contour.  Another contribution is a method for determining spring compliance in proportion to the distance between the point projections. This approach uniquely ensures a uniform degree of smoothing for corresponding curves, making the matching process robust to variations in point density and dependent only on measurement accuracy. Practical computations and the successful automatic reconstruction of the puzzle demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness.",Igor Orynyak,2025/11/8,2025/11/8,,N/A,['cs.CG']

To maximize its scientific reach, the EIC community has advocated for the addition of a second interaction region equipped with a detector complementary to the EIC general purpose collider detector, ePIC. The pre-conceptual design of this interaction region aims to provide a different configuration from the first interaction region, which enhances forward acceptance at very small scattering angles ($θ\sim 0$ mrad). This machine configuration would significantly benefit exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics programs, complementing those of the ePIC experiment. In particular, accessing coherent diffractive processes on light nuclei by tagging of the full, intact nucleus is essential for mapping their spatial parton distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study of the detection capabilities for light nuclei at a second EIC interaction region, with a detailed discussion of the accessible kinematic phase space and its implications for imaging.",Wan Chang,2025/11/7,2025/11/7,,N/A,"['nucl-ex', 'hep-ex', 'hep-ph']"

Unexpectedly, for the first time, we discover a mass-independent CDT in these black hole accretion systems, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars.

Nozzle oscillations, while limited to 35\% of overexpanded streamers and maintaining only 1-2 cycle coherence, play crucial secondary roles in vortex formation and provide the essential converging-diverging geometry for supersonic solar wind acceleration.

However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking.

We explore the possibility that the VHE component is produced in the jet at kpc scale through the inverse Compton emission of a population of ultra-high energy electrons (with Lorentz factor $γ\sim 10^8$). In the model these electrons are accelerated through the shear acceleration mechanism, and they also account for the still puzzling X-ray emission of knots detected by {\it Chandra} in the large-scale jets of several powerful quasars (including 3C273). In our scenario the VHE component can be interpreted as the integrated emission from the two brightest knots of the 3C273 jet.

Upon the occurrence of a certain event, the quantum system is randomly realized into one of the possible eigenstates due to its intrinsic stochasticity. While the randomness of a single realization cannot be controlled or predicted, the overall distribution can be regulated via experimental setup and converges as the number of events increases. A measurement is indeed an activity employing a certain event to convert a quantum effect into a macroscopic outcome. Consequently, the puzzling concepts of wavefunction collapse, many worlds, and decoherence become unnecessary for understanding quantum superposition. This expectation-realization interpretation, which integrates probability theory with wave mechanics, can also be extended to quantum pathways. Moreover, it reframes tests of Bell's inequalities as validating the wave-like probability nature of quantum mechanics, with no need to invoke the mysterious notions of quantum non-locality and ""spooky action at a distance"".",Yanting Wang,2025/11/6,2025/11/6,,N/A,['quant-ph']

In this work, novel dynamical duality-sequences are devised that provide natural constructions of de Sitter and quasi de Sitter excited states in the aforementioned theories allowing no late-time singularities. The emergent positive dark energies -- including the intriguing possibility of their slow temporal variations -- appear from Borel resumming Gevrey series from the path-integral representations of such states. Additionally, precise ways to handle the equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations and anomaly cancellations -- consistent with the underlying axionic cosmology and with the probability of forming wormholes that connect baby universes -- are presented for the SO(32) and the E_8 x E_8 theories within a framework that systematically incorporates perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in the far infrared. The temporally varying dark energy, which is much more natural in our set-up because of its emergent nature, surprisingly simplifies many of the aforementioned computations.

The corresponding entanglement entropy takes the form of a generalized horizon entropy in the bulk dual; revealing the emergence of edge modes in the entangling surfaces.

The high resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of planar defects in the lattice of the studied single crystals. Using a combination of microstructural and DFT analysis we demonstrated that a single planar nano-defects forms a layer of a distinct phase EuSnAs2, that is different from the EuSn2As2 phase of the bulk lattice. The smaller distance between Eu layers in the planar nano-defect promotes formation of local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Eu atoms. On average, the planar defects form a weak ferromagnetic phase in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice. The obtained results explain several puzzling features in magnetic properties of A-type AFM materials: the nonlinear magnetization in low in-plane fields, ferromagnetic-type hysteresis in low field, and the upturn of the magnetic susceptibility in the AFM state at temperatures approaching zero.",A.

However, there is a discrepancy in the ratio of the singly deuterated methanol isotopologues, CH2DOH/CH3OD, between low- and high-mass protostars, which puts into question whether prestellar isotopic ratios are generally preserved during the star- and planet-forming process. Resolving this puzzle is only made harder by the complete lack of data on this ratio in the prestellar stage. This work presents observations with the IRAM 30m telescope that securely detect CH3OD in the prestellar core L1448 in Perseus and tentatively in B213-C6 in Taurus. This work constrains the ratio of CH2DOH/CH3OD and the D/H ratios for both singly deuterated methanol isotopologues for the first time at the prestellar stage. Column densities calculated under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium lead to a CH2DOH/CH3OD ratio of 2.8-8.5 in L1448 and $\leq$ 5.7 in B213-C6. The values are marginally consistent with the statistically expected ratio of 3, but most assumptions put the values in an elevated range in line with values found around low-mass protostars. The D/H ratio in CH2DOH is between 3.6% and 6.8% in L1448 and in the range of 2.4-5.8% in B213-C6.

Its puzzling feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past. One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\lesssim$10 keV reflects that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line. While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.",Andrzej A.

Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.",Huseyin Goksu,2025/11/4,2025/11/4,,N/A,"['eess.SP', 'cs.LG']"
2511.02902v1,A close look at the black hole masses and hot dusty toruses of the first quasars with MIRI-MRS,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02902v1,"The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_\text{BH}\sim10^9 M_\odot$) at $z>7$ remains a puzzle. While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-$z$ quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at $7.08\leq z<7.64$. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, H$α$, Pa$α$ and Pa$β$, finding them to be in the range $(4-15)\cdot10^8 M_\odot$. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in $z<3$ quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle ($θ=40-60^\circ$) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass $(1-4)\cdot10^6 M_\odot$ in the tori, corresponding to $(0.2-7)\%$ of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only $\sim5$ Myr. Overall, we confirm that $z>7$ SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is $10\%$. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in $z>7$ quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at $z<3$.",Sarah E. I.

Prior work applied topological features to guide MCTS in ARC-style tasks using grid topology -- the Laplacian spectral properties of cell connectivity -- and found no benefit. We identify the root cause: grid topology is constant across all instances. We propose measuring \emph{solution space topology} instead: the structure of valid color assignments constrained by detected pattern rules. We build this via compatibility graphs where nodes are $(cell, color)$ pairs and edges represent compatible assignments under pattern constraints.  Our method: (1) detect pattern rules automatically with 100\% accuracy on 5 types, (2) construct compatibility graphs encoding solution space structure, (3) extract topological features (algebraic connectivity, rigidity, color structure) that vary with task difficulty, (4) integrate these features into MCTS node selection via sibling-normalized scores.  We provide formal definitions, a rigorous selection formula, and comprehensive ablations showing that algebraic connectivity is the dominant signal. The work demonstrates that topology matters for search -- but only the \emph{right} topology. For puzzle solving, this is solution space structure, not problem space structure.",Mirco A.

The I-spin counterpart for the interactions among nucleons has been extensively investigated, i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, which characterizes the variation of binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio in a nuclear system. In this work, we propose U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ for hyperonic matter to characterize the variation of the binding energy with the inclusion of hyperons. In particular, being the lightest hyperon, $Λ$ hyperons are included in dense matter, where the U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is fixed according to state-of-the-art constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysical observations using Bayesian inference approach. It is found that $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is much smaller than that of $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, indicating much stronger proton-neutron attraction than that of nucleon-hyperon pairs. Consequently, $Λ$ hyperon potential increases significantly and becomes repulsive at large density, where there is more than 80\% probability that $Λ$ hyperons do not emerge in neutron stars. For those undergoing emergence within neutron stars, the onset density of $Λ$ hyperons $n_\mathrm{b}^Λ$ is typically larger than $\sim$0.8 fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to neutron stars more massive than 1.7 $M_\odot$.",Hao-Song You,2025/11/3,2025/11/4,,N/A,"['hep-ph', 'astro-ph.HE']"

Previous research has linked this delayed generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.",Tiberiu Musat,2025/11/2,2025/11/2,,N/A,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']"

A long-standing puzzle concerns the stringy exclusion principle: what bulk mechanism can reproduce the boundary expectation that the chiral primary Hilbert space of the symmetric orbifold contains only a finite number of states at finite $N$? In this work, we present a bulk prescription for computing the finite $N$ spectrum of chiral primary states in symmetric orbifolds of $\mathbb{T}^4$ or K3. We show that the integer spectrum at any $N$ is reproduced exactly by summing over one-loop supersymmetric partition functions of the IIB theory on (AdS$_3$ $\times$ S$^3$)/$\mathbb{Z}_k$ $\times$ $\mathcal{M}_4$ orbifolds and their spectral flows. Using the worldsheet in the tensionless limit, we verify that the terms appearing in our proposal coincide with the partition functions of these orbifold geometries and their asymmetric generalizations. These partition functions contribute with alternating signs due to BPS modes with negative conformal dimensions and charges in twisted sectors. The resulting alternating sum collapses via large cancellations to the finite $N$ polynomials observed in symmetric orbifold CFTs, providing a bulk explanation of the stringy exclusion principle. We identify different Stokes sectors where different infinite subsets of these geometries contribute to the path integral, and propose a classification as functions of the chemical potentials.",Ji Hoon Lee,2025/11/1,2025/11/1,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc']"

Recent discoveries of hematite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ ), a highly oxidized form of iron, in the lunar polar regions challenge the prevailing understanding of the Moon's reducing environment. This study, using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid impacts on fayalite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{SiO}_4$ ), investigates the atomistic mechanisms leading to both reduced and oxidized iron species. Our simulations reveals that the high-temperature and pressure conditions at the impact crater surface produces a reduced iron environment while providing a transient oxygen-rich environment in the expanding plume. Our findings bridge previously disparate observations-linking impact-driven $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ formation to the puzzling presence of oxidized iron phases on the Moon, completing the observed strong dichotomous distribution of hematite between the nearside and farside of the Moon.

The rewards are designed to enhance a puzzle's uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, diversity, and realism. Our RL approach dramatically increases counter-intuitive puzzle generation by 10x, from 0.22\% (supervised) to 2.5\%, surpassing existing dataset rates (2.1\%) and the best Lichess-trained model (0.4\%). Our puzzles meet novelty and diversity benchmarks, retain aesthetic themes, and are rated by human experts as more creative, enjoyable, and counter-intuitive than composed book puzzles, even approaching classic compositions.

We discuss how the algebraic Ìnönü-Wigner contraction captures the local physics of the equivalence principle in quantum field theory in a fixed background description. We develop the embedding formalism to describe the bulk AdS scalar primary wave functions as holomorphic functions. Flat space massive particle states are built out of the AdS primary together with AdS boosted wave functions. We compute their inner products and show that these become orthogonal in the flat limit, resulting in the correct continuous spectrum for a standard unitary representation of the Lorentz group. In this same limit the original AdS descendants become null states. We also argue how the flat space S-matrix emerges from standard perturbation theory in the interaction picture. To obtain flat space massless particles requires to consider a double scaled limit in which the boost rapidity is scaled to infinity keeping the average particle energy in the flat space limit fixed. We comment on how this limit generates interesting massless state wave functions with non-trivial shape profiles that remember the dimension of the AdS operator.

To explicitly model dependencies among tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves global consistency.

We introduce PRISM-Bench, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults.

While resting-state fMRI studies have revealed large-scale network correlates of creative potential, electroencephalography (EEG) offers a temporally precise and scalable approach to capture the fast oscillatory dynamics that underlie spontaneous neural organization. In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns can index stable cognitive traits such as creativity.

We offer a mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A simple linear probe decodes the internal ""solvability belief"" of a model, revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge - although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged, indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.",Debdeep Sanyal,2025/10/24,2025/10/24,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']"

We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in generated text.

Among these, chemical depletion (underabundance of refractory elements in stellar photospheres) presents a key puzzle in understanding the full chemical lifecycle. This PhD thesis explores the role of disc-binary interaction in shaping chemical abundances in evolved low- and intermediate-mass binary stars, focusing on systems that have undergone the red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. In this thesis, we investigate binary systems containing post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB, $L_{\rm post-AGB}\,\gtrsim\,2\,500\,L_\odot$) and post-red giant branch (post-RGB, $L_{\rm post-RGB}\,\lesssim\,2\,500\,L_\odot$) binaries as key tracers of AGB/RGB nucleosynthesis. Although the effects of these interactions remain poorly understood, they are known to drive photospheric chemical depletion. This depletion closely resembles that observed in young planet-hosting stars with protoplanetary discs. Combined with other structural and dynamical similarities in disc properties, this suggests a potential link to second-generation planet formation in post-AGB/RGB binaries with circumbinary discs. Although direct imaging of such planets is not feasible, studying signatures such as photospheric depletion provides an indirect means of exploring their possible presence within these systems.",Maksym Mohorian,2025/10/24,2025/10/24,,N/A,['astro-ph.SR']

To investigate this, we train a 270M parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios, designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles. In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess.

I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs 0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling for current economic conditions, a ""scarring"" effect documented by Malmendier and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond what current economic conditions would predict.",Brandon Kaplowitz,2025/10/23,2025/10/23,,N/A,"['econ.GN', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"

We were therefore very surprised to find cases of disks embedded in rigid halos, which on the basis of widely-cited criteria should be unstable, that appeared to be robustly stable. Here we show that the unstable bar mode in such simulations was being suppressed by changes to the disk caused by other instabilities having higher angular symmetry that were the first to saturate. Although this may seem like a promising solution to the long-standing puzzle presented by the apparent stability of real disk galaxies, we also show that instability is restored in the same models when the rigid halo is replaced by a live population of particles, where the usual stability conditions apply. Our study has been confined to a narrow range of models, and we cannot therefore exclude the possibility that mode interference may be able to prevent bar formation in other models having live halos.",J.

The mean, variance, and two-time correlations are computed exactly and lead to a picture of quasiparticles as drifting Brownian particles. For the case of a homogeneous background, we show that the motion of two tagged quasiparticles is strongly correlated, and they move like a rigid rod at late times. Apart from a microscopic derivation based on the mapping to point particles, we provide an alternate derivation which emphasizes that quasiparticle fluctuations are related to initial phase-space fluctuations, which are carried over in time by Euler scale dynamics. For the homogeneous state, we use the Brownian motion picture to develop a Dean-Kawasaki-type fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, formally having the same structure as that derived recently by Ferrari and Olla.

We train linear probes across layers and token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable (AMC: $ρ\approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling, whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly. Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward ""easier"" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance.

Utilizing rich French administrative panel data (2012-2019), this study has two main contributions: first, it presents a set of new, intuitive yet previously undocumented stylized facts about wage dynamics, sectoral mobility, and gender differences across sectors. The results reveal that the modest hourly wage gaps conceal substantial disparities in lifetime earnings and employment stability. Women, in particular, gain a significant lifetime earnings advantage in the public sector, driven by higher retention, better-compensated part-time work, and more equitable annual hours compared to the private sector, where gender gaps remain larger, especially for those with higher education. In contrast, highly educated men experience a lifetime penalty in public employment due to rigid wage structures. By flexibly modeling sectoral transitions, transitions into and out of employment, and earnings heterogeneity using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, this study shows that both premiums and penalties depend systematically on gender, education, and labor market experience. The analysis reveals that significant unobserved heterogeneity remains in wage dynamics.

However, their ability to solve more complex optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator, (ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge), as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws of RLVR.",Xiaozhe Li,2025/10/18,2025/10/18,,N/A,['cs.AI']
2510.16348v1,Electron Localization in Non-Compact Covalent Bonds Captured by the r2SCAN+V Approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16348v1,"In density functional theory, the SCAN (Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed) and r2SCAN functionals significantly improve over generalized gradient approximation functionals such as PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) in predicting electronic, magnetic, and structural properties across various materials, including transition-metal compounds. However, there remain puzzling cases where SCAN and r2SCAN underperform, such as in calculating the band structure of graphene, the magnetic moment of Fe, the potential energy curve of the Cr2 molecule, and the bond length of VO2. This research identifies a common characteristic among these challenging materials: non-compact covalent bonding through s-s, p-p, or d-d electron hybridization. While SCAN and r2SCAN excel at capturing electron localization at local atomic sites, they struggle to accurately describe electron localization in non-compact covalent bonds, resulting in a biased improvement. To address this issue, we propose the r2SCAN+V approach as a practical modification that improves accuracy across all the tested materials. The parameter V is 4 eV for metallic Fe, but substantially lower for the other cases.

A significant fraction of presolar graphites shows isotopic abundance anomalies relative to solar for elements such as O, Si, Mg and Ca, which are compatible with nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Therefore, they must have condensed from CCSN ejecta before the formation of the Sun. Their most puzzling abundance signature is the $^{22}$Ne-enriched component Ne-E(L), interpreted as the effect of the radioactive decay of $^{22}$Na ($T_{1/2}$ = 2.6 years). Previous works have shown that if H is ingested into the He shell and not fully destroyed before the explosion, the CCSN shock in the He shell material produces large $^{22}$Na amounts. Here we focus on such CCSN models, showing a radioactive $^{26}$Al production compatible with grains measurements, and analyze the conditions of $^{22}$Na nucleosynthesis. In these models, $^{22}$Na is mostly made in the He shell, with a total ejected mass varying between 2.6$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 1.9$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that such $^{22}$Na may already impact the CCSN light curve 500 days after the explosion, and at later stages it can be the main source powering the CCSN light curve for up to a few years before the $^{44}$Ti decay becomes dominant. Based on the CCSN yields above, the 1274.53 keV $γ$-ray flux due to $^{22}$Na decay could be observable for years after the first CCSN light is detected, depending on the distance. This makes CCSNe possible sites to detect a $^{22}$Na $γ$-ray signature consistently with the Ne-E(L) component found in presolar graphites.

Recent works have sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning. However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2) incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer. Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model retains 83% of its original average accuracy.

Holomarket is designed to simulate a supermarket shopping experience, helping users develop essential life skills such as item selection, basic arithmetic, and money handling. Participants interacted with augmented food items and a smart cash register, navigating a virtual supermarket environment. While participants enjoyed the realistic setting and tangible interactions, some usability challenges, such as difficulty manipulating virtual objects and discomfort with prolonged headset use, were noted. ATOF transforms the user environment into an oceanic world, where participants use a dolphin-shaped smart object to complete tasks like collecting items and solving puzzles. This application aims to improve motor coordination and cognitive skills. Participants appreciated the immersive experience, the customizable tasks, and the tangible dolphin interface. However, some faced difficulties interacting with specific virtual elements.

Similarly, EWP diagrams are related to tree diagrams. These SU(3)$_F$ EWP-tree relations were recently used in global analyses of $B \to PP$ decays. They have also been used over the years in analyses of the $B \to πK$ puzzle, even though the $B \to πK$ amplitudes are related by isospin symmetry [SU(2)$_I$], and not the full SU(3)$_F$. In this paper, we show that, even if only SU(2)$_I$ is assumed, there are still EWP-tree relations. In $ΔS=0$ decays, these relations are similar to those of SU(3)$_F$, and can be used to take into account the EWP contributions in the extraction of the CP phase $α$ from $B \to ππ$ decays. In $ΔS=1$ decays, the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations are quite different from those of SU(3)$_F$; when these are used to analyze the $B \to πK$ puzzle, one now finds a 4-5$σ$ discrepancy with the SM, much larger than what was previously found. We argue that, if one analyzes a set of hadronic $B$ decays whose amplitudes are related by isospin, one must use the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations for that set of decays in the analysis.",Bhubanjyoti Bhattacharya,2025/10/15,2025/10/15,,N/A,['hep-ph']

However, whether they can flexibly apply appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the ""long-tail"" of logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization. Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty.

Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues? To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25 well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom recall and over-elaboration.

The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z < 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature is clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4--8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies.

Utilizing the latest HFLAV averages and incorporating the branching ratio constraints $60\%$, $30\%$ and $10\%$ from the lifetime of the $B_c$ meson, we determine the values of the Wilson coefficients (WCs) for different New Physics (NP) four-fermion operator with specific Lorentz structures. Our analysis finds that the WC scenario $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$ is the most probable, the maximum pull from the SM, and strongly influenced by branching ratio constraints. Furthermore, we identify three degenerate solutions involving $C_{V_{L}}$, $C_{V_{L}}^{\prime}$, $C_{V_{L}}^{\prime\prime}$, and $C_{S_{R}}^{\prime\prime}$ as the second most probable NP scenarios. We then studied the influence of these NP operators on various physical observables in $Λ_{b}\rightarrowΛ_{c}τ\barν_τ$ decay by using the Lattice QCD form factors. Our results highlighted $C_{S_{L}}^{\prime\prime}$, $C_{S_{R}}$, $C_{T}$, $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$, $\left(C_{S_{R}},C_{T}\right)$, and the three degenerate scenarios involving $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{T}\right)$, $\left(C_{S_{L}}^{\prime},C_{T}^{\prime}\right)$ and $\left(C_{S_{L}}^{\prime\prime},C_{T}^{\prime\prime}\right)$ as strong indicators of NP.

The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions: Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles. Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution.",Beining Wang,2025/10/13,2025/10/13,,N/A,['cs.AI']

The vanishingly low probability of the natural codon-to-amino acid mapping arising by chance has spurred the hypothesis that its structure is a solution optimized for robustness against mutations and translational errors. For the construction of effective molecular machines, the dictionary of encoded amino acids must also be diverse enough in physicochemical features. Here, we examine whether the standard genetic code can be understood as a near-optimal solution balancing these two objectives: minimizing error load and aligning codon assignments with the naturally occurring amino acid composition. Using simulated annealing, we explore this trade-off across a broad range of parameters. We find that the standard genetic code lies near local optima within the multidimensional parameter space. It is a highly effective solution that balances fidelity against resource availability constraints.

We provide a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects the correct solution for the problem.

In this work, we introduce a novel, Physics-Informed Machine Learning method to reconstruct the 3D structure of the lower solar atmosphere based on the output of optical depth sampled spectropolarimetric inversions, wherein both the fully disambiguated vector magnetic fields and the geometric height associated with each optical depth are returned simultaneously. Traditional techniques typically resolve the 180-degree azimuthal ambiguity assuming a single layer, either ignoring the intrinsic non-planar physical geometry of constant optical-depth surfaces (e.g., the Wilson depression in sunspots), or correcting the effect as a post-processing step. In contrast, our approach simultaneously maps the optical depths to physical heights, and enforces the divergence-free condition for magnetic fields fully in 3D. Tests on magnetohydrodynamic simulations of quiet Sun, plage, and a sunspot demonstrate that our method reliably recovers the horizontal magnetic field orientation in locations with appreciable magnetic field strength. By coupling the resolutions of the azimuthal ambiguity and the geometric heights problems, we achieve a self-consistent reconstruction of the 3D vector magnetic fields and, by extension, the electric current density and Lorentz force.

The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges.

Especially, we focus on why misinformation persists and diffuses despite being recognized by most as false. In our psychological game theoretical model, each agent who receives a piece of (mis)information must first decide how to react -- by openly endorsing it, remaining silent, or openly challenging it. After observing the reactions of her neighbors who also received the message, the agent then chooses whether to forward it to others in her own chatroom who have not yet received it. By distinguishing these two roles, our framework addresses puzzling real-world phenomena, such as the gap between what individuals privately believe and what they publicly transmit. A key assumption in our model is that, while perceived veracity influences decisions, the dominant factor is the alignment between an agent's beliefs and those of her social network -- a feature characteristic of communities formed through long-term offline relationships. This dynamic can lead agents to tacitly accept and even propagate information they privately judge to be of low credibility. Our results challenge the view that improving information literacy alone can curb the spread of misinformation. We show that when agents are highly sensitive to peer pressure and the network exhibits structural polarization, even if the majority does not genuinely believe in it, the message still can spread widely without encountering open resistance.",Shuige Liu,2025/10/9,2025/10/9,,N/A,['econ.GN']

For the hypertriton, the model predictions are highly sensitive to the assumed wave function. This sensitivity is strongest at low collision energies and in low-multiplicity environments, implying that such conditions are particularly valuable for probing hypernuclear structure.",Yue Hang Leung,2025/10/8,2025/10/8,,N/A,['nucl-th']
2510.06477v1,Attention Sinks and Compression Valleys in LLMs are Two Sides of the Same Coin,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06477v1,"Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying differences in task-dependent representations.",Enrique Queipo-de-Llano,2025/10/7,2025/10/7,,N/A,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']"

The PuzzlePlex framework provides a comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings: instruction-based and code-based.

2510.06135v1,Pushing Test-Time Scaling Limits of Deep Search with Asymmetric Verification,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06135v1,"Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4 Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles), verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their ``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research.

In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of the hadronic contributions to the $h \to γγ$ decay width using dispersion relations. Our analysis shows that these contributions are exceedingly small, as expected, altering the decay width by about $0.004\%$ under conservative assumptions. Therefore, hadronic effects can be safely neglected even in the context of future high-precision Higgs measurements at current and next-generation colliders.

We observe that the volume of the Sasaki-Einstein base of the Calabi-Yau 4-fold grows towards the IR, signaling the relevance of deformations. We exploit the map between gauge theory fields and GLSM fields to compute scaling dimensions directly from divisor volumes, allowing for a sharper determination of whether terms in the Lagrangian are relevant or irrelevant. Moreover, this map provides a systematic way to determine the precise set of terms needed to realize a given deformation. We also explore the interplay between general relevant deformations and triality, studying cases where non-mass deformations are mapped to mass deformations in a dual theory, and resolving puzzles that seem to require non-holomorphic couplings in one of the dual phases. Finally, we present evidence that when the Hilbert series of the mesonic moduli space is refined only under the U(1) R-symmetry, it becomes invariant even under non-mass relevant deformations of the brane brick models corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds related by a birational transformation, extending previous results to a broader class of deformations.",Mario Carcamo,2025/10/7,2025/10/7,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'math-ph']"

It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently samplable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In this setting we can hope to construct efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verification of classical/quantum distributions with classical/quantum cryptography, showing the following results:  (1). Classically efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable if and only if one-way functions do not exist. (2). Quantumly efficiently samplable distributions are verifiable by $\mathbf{P}^\mathbf{PP}$ with a polynomial number of samples. (3). Sampling-based quantum advantage can be verified quantumly (with a polynomial number of samples) if one-way puzzles do not exist. (4).

OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum cryptographic primitives, and imply several important applications such as non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions that will not imply OWFs. In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class, $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$, which is a sampling version of the decision class $\mathbf{PDQP}$ introduced in [Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, ITCS 2016]. We show that if $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is hard on average for quantum polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is the class of sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a ''magical'' oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum polynomial-time. We also study upperbounds of the hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$.

A PoQM is an interactive protocol between a classical probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) verifier and a quantum polynomial-time (QPT) prover over a classical channel where the verifier can verify that the prover has possessed a quantum memory with a certain number of qubits during a specified period of time. PoQM generalize the notion of proofs of quantumness (PoQ) [Brakerski, Christiano, Mahadev, Vazirani, and Vidick, JACM 2021]. Our main contributions are a formal definition of PoQM and its constructions based on hardness of LWE. Specifically, we give two constructions of PoQM. The first is of a four-round and has negligible soundness error under subexponential-hardness of LWE. The second is of a polynomial-round and has inverse-polynomial soundness error under polynomial-hardness of LWE. As a lowerbound of PoQM, we also show that PoQM imply one-way puzzles.

Then, we use one of the examples to introduce multiple ways to infuse heuristic knowledge and reduce solving time. stableKanren is an extension of miniKanren that supports normal logic programs under stable model semantics. stableKanren further supports numeric computation by constructing a constraint store for integrity constraints. There are three ways to extend a relational programming language with numeric computations: relational number representation, grounding numbers to symbols, and constraint store construction. We demonstrate that the numeric computations in stableKanren have a straightforward numerical representation compared to relational number representations. More importantly, stableKanren balances symbolic and numeric computation in relational programming by avoiding the grounding of all numbers to symbols. Lastly, it also has simpler syntax compared to other constraint store construction approaches. stableKanren supports combinatorial search problem solving under a declarative generate and test paradigm. Such a paradigm generates all possible combinations of solutions to the problem, then applies a set of constraints to prune out the unwanted solutions. We demonstrate that different approaches to writing programs or queries affect the solver's performance in the SEND+MORE=MONEY puzzle. The performance gradually improves as more heuristic knowledge is infused through the programs or queries.

By carefully examining how the Drude-Boltzmann expression for the $c$-axis conductivity emerges out of the Kubo formula, we find, besides the standard metallic term proportional to the carrier lifetime $τ$, a non-Drude contribution proportional to $1/τ$. The Drude behavior breaks down when $1/τ> 2 η^*$, the crossover value $η^*$ being small (and hence observable) when the $c$-axis velocities vary rapidly with the distance from the Fermi surface. We consider the Hund metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as a test case, which we study within a realistic dynamical mean-field theory approach. The non-Drude behavior observed experimentally in $c$-axis transport is reproduced and explained by our considerations, showing that earlier invoked extrinsic mechanisms that involve either impurities or phonons are unnecessary. We point out that the small value of $η^*$ is due to a peculiar accidental cancellation due to destructive interference characteristic of body-centered tetragonal lattices.",Sophie Beck,2025/10/4,2025/10/4,,N/A,"['cond-mat.str-el', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci']"

One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p<0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study.

Distinguishing recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure component contributions to each task type. Across two model families (Qwen and LLaMA), we find that interventions on distinct layers and attention heads lead to selective impairments: disabling identified ""recall circuits"" reduces fact-retrieval accuracy by up to 15\% while leaving reasoning intact, whereas disabling ""reasoning circuits"" reduces multi-step inference by a comparable margin. At the neuron level, we observe task-specific firing patterns, though these effects are less robust, consistent with neuronal polysemanticity.Our results provide the first causal evidence that recall and reasoning rely on separable but interacting circuits in transformer models.

These pre-peaks are puzzling in view of the apparently contradicting facts that neat amines show pre-peaks much weaker than neat alkanols, while water-rich aqueous alcohols do not. These observations can be intuitively rationalized by noting that the amine head group have two hydrogen atoms when the hydroxyl group have only one, but they oppose the following two facts: i) computer simulations show micro-heterogeneity for both systems; ii) amines mix with water better than alcohols, both over larger concentrations and alkyl tails lengths.  The study of the atom-atom pair correlation functions and related structure factors allows to understand the microscopic molecular details. The most interesting observation is that the amine head groups accumulate preferentially at the surface of the water domains, and increasingly better with longer alkyl tail, thus allowing to stabilize both the water and alkylamine domains, hence avoiding macroscopic demixing, except at high water concentrations when amines are scarce to achieve efficient surface saturation. The amine domains appear as disordered bilayers. Hence, aqueous amines are analogous to an inverse micelle melt and as precursor micro-emulsion.  This stable micro-segregation produces large domain oscillations in the long range part of the correlation functions, translating into positive pre-peaks and negative anti-peaks in the related structure factors, the latter which contribute destructively to produce the prominent scattering pre-peak observed in the x-ray experiments.  The model dependence is shown to be quite important, both for water and solute models.

An unbiased comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$β$. These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\approx$10$^{8.7}$ M$_\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\sim$ 0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission, rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.",P.

While modern video games may offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL experimentation.",Waris Radji,2025/10/2,2025/10/3,,N/A,['cs.LG']

2510.01421v3,Ly-alpha emission reveals two satellite halos around massive groups at z ~ 3: the puzzling case of a quiescent central galaxy,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01421v3,"We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$α$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$α$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$α$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$α$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$α$-selected galaxy groups.",Sicen Guo,2025/10/1,2025/11/7,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']

As skills develop, the type and frequency of struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68 hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition, participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in struggle detection.

First, we find that the improvements arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones. Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module (ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward, implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement. Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.",Zeru Shi,2025/10/1,2025/10/1,,N/A,['cs.LG']

Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.",Wei Zhu,2025/10/1,2025/10/3,,N/A,"['hep-ph', 'astro-ph.HE', 'nlin.CD', 'nucl-th']"

With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant ($\sim 3σ$) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime ($> 2 \times 10^{24} $cm$^{-2}$) with a large covering factor, approaching 4$π$. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments.

Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial, and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks, current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example, the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench.

Here we discuss the neutrino mixing matrix parameterization for three known flavours of neutrinos based on the SO(3) group represented by one three-dimensional rotation matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$. The mixing matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$ with cyclic order of the Lie group generators implies $δ_{\rm{CP}}=180^\circ$ for clockwise rotation in three dimensions, a viable scenario for normal mass ordering. We determine a range of rotation angles for $U_{\rm SO3}$ which deviate substantially from the almost maximal mixings in the standard $U_{\rm PMNS}$ scenario, yielding `democratic' values for the mixing angles. With the fixed $δ_{\rm CP}$ value, the $U_{\rm SO3}$ parameterization can be validated or falsified by the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and puts a stringent constraint on the absolute neutrino mass. The proposed $U_{\rm SO3}$ neutrino mixing parameterization is suited for independent CP-conserving neutrino oscillation experimental analysis.",Jarosław Duda,2025/9/29,2025/10/20,,N/A,['hep-ph']

We show that axion dark matter decay in the intergalactic medium can account for this energy injection. We use a single zone model of the gas core and semi-analytically evolve its chemo-thermal properties to track the conditions for which the system becomes an atomic cooling halo-a necessary precursor for the production of heavy black hole seeds to explain the high-redshift black hole population. Windows of axions masses between 24.5-26.5 eV with photon couplings as low as $4\times 10^{-12}$/GeV may realize this atomic cooling halo condition.

However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension, and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily.

In this work, we develop a framework to assess the strangeness enhancement scenario, wherein an increased yield of kaons relative to pions boosts muon production. Using the MCEQ air-shower simulation package, we first identify the key phase-space regions of hadronic interactions that drive muon yields in this scenario. We then demonstrate that combining Pierre Auger Observatory muon measurements with forthcoming kaon-to-pion ratio data from LHC Run~3 can robustly constrain the scenario's parameters. In particular, we find that achieving 10.8% precision on the kaon-to-pion ratio at LHCb and 8.4% at FASER is sufficient to test the strangeness enhancement hypothesis over its viable parameter space.

While hydrodynamics has traditionally been associated with the onset of local thermal equilibrium, its derivations -- whether microscopic or macroscopic -- rely instead on linearization around equilibrium. However, the linearization timescale -- the time at which a system's evolution begins to follow a linearized equation -- has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we employ the spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation -- the lowest-order truncation of the spectral Bogoliubov--Born--Green--Kirkwood--Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy -- to analyze the timescales of linearization and thermalization under three distinct truncation schemes. The first two truncations allow for analytic treatment via recursive spectral equations, while the third requires numerical methods for generic initial conditions. The analysis is performed for a homogeneous, massless system with a constant differential cross section. For this simplified setup, we find a robust separation: the linearization time is consistently about half the thermalization time ($τ_{\mathrm{lin}}/τ_{\mathrm{therm}} \approx 1/2$). This separation of timescales suggests an explanation for the early applicability of hydrodynamics and points toward a possible quantitative resolution of the early thermalization puzzle.",Xingjian Lu,2025/9/28,2025/9/28,,N/A,"['hep-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'math-ph', 'nucl-th']"

At present, most of superconducting diodes require an external magnetic field or proximity effect to break time reversal symmetry (TRS). The cases of intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) under zero magnetic field are relatively scarce, and there are still some puzzles especially regarding the reasons for the TRS breaking. Here, we not only report field free SDE in NbSe2 induced by strain, but also large values of the difference of Ic+ and |Ic-| (ΔIc) of 286 μA and the superconducting diode efficiency (η) of 6.76 % are achieved. Interestingly, ΔIc varies with the magnetic field and exhibits two distinct evolutionary behaviors with B-odd or B-even symmetry in various devices. We attribute this to the selective activation of two independent, spatially-orthogonal mechanisms: a stress-induced real-space polarity and a field-induced reciprocal-space asymmetric energy bands. In general, we propose an extremely effectively method to produce field free SDE, even when the material itself does not possess field free SDE, and provide new perspectives to understand the SDE which build new avenues for superconducting quantum devices.",Jiajun Li,2025/9/28,2025/9/28,,N/A,['cond-mat.mtrl-sci']

In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME).

Friends-and-strangers graphs were first introduced by Defant and Kravitz, and generalize sliding puzzles as well as token swapping problems. Previous work has largely focused on their connectivity properties. In this paper, we study the diameter of the connected components of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$. Our main result shows that when the underlying friendship graph is a star with $n$ vertices, the friends-and-strangers graph has components of diameter $O(n^4)$. This implies, in particular, that sliding puzzles are always solvable in polynomially many moves. Our work also provides explicit efficient algorithms for finding these solutions.  We then extend our results to general graphs in two ways. First, we show that the diameter is polynomially bounded when both the friendship and the movement graphs have large minimum degree. Second, when both the underlying graphs $X$ and $Y$ are Erdős-Rényi random graphs, we show that the distance between any pair of configurations is almost always polynomially bounded under certain conditions on the edge probabilities.",Amogh Akella,2025/9/27,2025/9/27,,N/A,"['math.CO', 'cs.DM', 'math.PR']"

2509.22378v1,Zero-Effort Image-to-Music Generation: An Interpretable RAG-based VLM Approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22378v1,"Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results.

NaI(Tl) crystals with radiopurity comparable to DAMA/LIBRA's are essential for adequate verification. Existing experiments using NaI(Tl) target have been hampered by the high radioactivity concentration of NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON experiment conducts an independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using highest purity NaI(Tl) crystals. In 2020, the NaI(Tl) crystal (Ingot#85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The DAMA/LIBRA group has stressed that verifying their signal requires high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals with long-term stability. Based on a six-month measurement, we have confirmed the long-term stability of its radiopurity. This stability provides a significant advantage for future efforts to adequately verify the DAMA/LIBRA result using NaI(Tl) crystal.

We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience.

2509.20622v1,Negative Charge Transfer: Ground State Precursor towards High Energy Batteries,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20622v1,"Modern energy applications, especially electric vehicles, demand high energy batteries. However, despite decades of intensive efforts, the highest energy density and commercially viable batteries are still based on LiCoO2, the very first generation of cathode materials. The technical bottleneck is the stability of oxide-based cathodes at high operating voltages. The fundamental puzzle is that we actually never understood the redox mechanism of LiCoO2. Conventional wisdom generally defines redox to be centered on cations at low voltages, and on anions, i.e. oxygen, at high voltages by forming oxidized chemical states like O2 or peroxo-species. Here, through in-situ and ex-situ spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations, we show that high-energy layered cathodes, represented by LiCoO2 and LiNiO2, operate through enhancement of negative charge transfer (NCT) ground states upon charging throughout the whole voltage range - i.e., NCT evolution itself is the intrinsic redox mechanism regardless of voltage ranges. NCT inherently engages high covalency and oxygen holes, leading to optimized performance without conventional redox centers in LiCoO2. The level of NCT, i.e., number of ligand holes, naturally explains many seemingly controversial results. The redefinition of redox mechanism reveals the pathway toward viable high energy battery electrodes.",Eder G. Lomeli,2025/9/24,2025/9/24,,N/A,"['cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.str-el']"

It relates the decrease in surface tension to an increased surfactant adsorption. In the early 1940's, it therefore puzzled researchers to sometimes observe a minimum in the surface tension for certain surfactant solutions, which seemed to indicate surfactant desorption (even depletion) according to the Gibbs adsorption equation. It is now understood that the minimum is related to contamination of the surfactant (notably by dodecanol) and its occurrence has since then been studied extensively in experiments. Still, the precise role of the (tiny amount of) contaminant present is not well understood and a quantitative description and understanding of the minimum in the experimental surface tension is lacking. It is the aim of the present article to provide such a quantitative description. Our theoretical analysis is based on a Statistical Thermodynamic treatment of the Langmuir model for a surfactant mixture combined with the mass action model adapted to describe the formation of mixed micelles. A new Statistical Thermodynamic expression for the surface tension is derived and used to compare with a number of surface tension experiments for both ionic and non-ionic surfactant systems.",Edgar M.

Beyond this fundamental mystery, the origin of vitrimers' Arrhenius viscosity in the presence of super-Arrhenius structural relaxation behavior has been of high interest due to vitrimers' potential to provide readily reprocessable high-performance plastics. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to establish a foundational understanding of vitrimer relaxation dynamics. We identify two types of transient networks based on the ratio of atomic displacement scales required for bond exchange to those required to relax a segment. In systems where bond exchange only requires sub-segmental motion, we show that network relaxation is governed by a competition between chemical exchange reactions and segmental diffusion. This competition produces vitrimers' signature network/segment decoupling, while also driving a crossover between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius behavior that is observed for many vitrimers. This work provides an explanation for longstanding puzzling features of vitrimer dynamics and establishes a foundation for rational vitrimer design.",Makayla R.

Understanding this process requires the reconstruction of cluster merger geometry, with careful consideration of projection effects. With its unprecedented spectral resolution, XRISM enables the disentanglement of merging cluster components along the line-of-sight via X-rays for the first time. In this letter, we focus on the massive cluster A1914, a puzzling case wherein the galaxy and dark matter distribution appear to be in tension with the X-ray morphology. We present XRISM observations of A1914 focusing on the velocity structure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The Resolve full-array spectrum requires two merging components along the line-of-sight, with bulk velocities offset by $\sim$1000 km/s and velocity dispersions of $\sim$200 km/s. The sub-array maps of flux ratios, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion show the two components are offset and overlapping in the plane of the sky, consistent with a major (mass ratio $\sim$3), near line-of-sight merger with a pericenter distance of $\sim$200 kpc. We conclude that the two subclusters create an overlapping spiral pattern, referred to as a ''yin-yang'' merger. This scenario is further supported by tailored hydrodynamical simulations of the A1914 merger, demonstrating that this type of merger can broadly reproduce the observed X-ray morphology, gas temperature map, gas velocity maps, dark matter distribution, and galaxy velocities. This work demonstrates the power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, provided by XRISM, to resolve complex cluster merger geometries.",Annie Heinrich,2025/9/23,2025/9/23,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.GA']"
2509.19240v1,3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19240v1,"The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4π$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.",Joshua Issa,2025/9/23,2025/9/23,,N/A,"['astro-ph.SR', 'astro-ph.EP', 'astro-ph.GA']"

Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios.

For theories with vectorlike matter content we find on the first sheet ($q \to 1$) that $Z(q) \sim β^{-\#}$, where the exponent $\#$ is determined by a $multiscale\ decomposition$ of the BPS moduli space appearing in the localization formula for the index. On the second sheet ($q \to e^{2πi})$ we find $Z(q) \sim e^{\#/ β}$, and that the long-standing puzzle of apparent gauge-enhancing saddles is resolved (in the absence of Chern--Simons couplings) via a novel $Lorentzian\ factorization$ formula that establishes complete screening.  A key insight is the use of $Poisson\ resummation$, which streamlines the asymptotic analysis, sharpens the link to Kaluza--Klein effective field theory, and provides a dual description of parts of the BPS moduli space in terms of punctured surfaces. The Lorentzian factorization formula also emerges from Poisson resummation, though applied after a contour crossing in moduli space.

These experiments reveal how an agent's moral framework, in combination with its cognitive constraints, directly shapes its behavior and determines its evolutionary outcome. Crucially, the emergent patterns echo seminal theories from related domains of social science, providing external validation for the simulations. This work establishes LLM-based simulation as a powerful new paradigm to complement traditional research in evolutionary biology and anthropology, opening new avenues for investigating the complexities of moral and social evolution.",Zhou Ziheng,2025/9/22,2025/9/22,,N/A,['cs.MA']

By using the self-reciprocal property between coexistenct phases, we further establish that under suitable conditions, the Ising symmetry generally emerges in the scaling regime for a general universality class. As a consequence, the thermodynamic crossovers $L^\pm$ generally exhibit an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry in the scaling regime. This partly resolves the symmetry puzzle raised by the Ising model.

Thus far most evolutionary theory concerns the genetics of aging with limited physiological integration. Here we present an intuitive evolutionary framework built on how physiology is regulated and how this regulation itself is then predicted to age. Life has evolved to secure reproduction and avoid system failure in early life, and it is the physiological regulation that evolves in response to those early life selection pressures that leads to the emergence of aging. Importantly, asymmetrical regulation of physiology will evolve as the Darwinian fitness costs of loss of regulation will not be symmetrical. When asymmetrical regulatory systems break during aging, they cause physiological function to drift towards the physiological range where costs of dysregulation are lowest, rendering aging directional. Our model explains many puzzling aspects of the biology of aging. These include why aging appears (but is not) programmed, why aging is gradual yet heterogeneous, why cellular and hormonal signaling are closely related to aging, the compensation law of mortality, why trade-offs between reproduction and aging remain elusive, why longer-lived organisms show more signs of aging during their natural lifespans, and why longer-lived organisms can be less responsive to treatments of aging that work well in short-lived organisms.

We propose to resolve this problem in a comprehensive study of isoscalar two-pion state ($[ππ]_{\rm S}$), the signal channel of $f_0(980)$, through its light-cone distribution amplitudes ($2π$DAs). A key finding is that charge parity forces the twist-3 $2π$DAs to be asymmetric in the momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark. This property stands in stark contrast to the symmetric twist-3 distribution amplitudes of a conventional $f_0(980)$ meson, as derived from QCD sum rules in the narrow-width approximation. We calculate the $D_s \to [ππ]_{\rm S}$ transition form factors and discover a significant cancellation between the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions. This leads to a QCD prediction for the $D_s^+ \to [ππ]_{\rm S} e^+ ν_e$ decay width that is significantly smaller than the experimental measurement. Our results indicate that the lowest Fock state is not the dominant configuration of the isoscalar two-pion state produced in charm decays, in contrast to the case in $B$ decays. Future precision measurements can constrain the high-twist $2π$DAs associated with multi-particle Fock states, offering a new path to elucidate the structure of the light scalar mesons.",Shan Cheng,2025/9/19,2025/9/19,,N/A,['hep-ph']

While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and Rényi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton.

We show that the algebraic formulation of AdS/CFT--and in particular the subregion-subalgebra duality--provides a natural framework for describing such universes within the standard AdS/CFT setting, phrased in terms of an operator algebra ${\cal M}$ and a state $ω$ on that algebra, with no need to introduce observers. The algebra encodes all physical operations in the closed universe, and, in principle, all physical observables are obtainable from the pair $({\cal M},ω)$. Along the way, we propose a resolution to a puzzle raised by Antonini and Rath (AR) and reinforced by recent arguments of Engelhardt and Gesteau and a no-go theorem of Gesteau: that a semiclassical baby universe in the AS$^2$ cosmology cannot be understood from the boundary in the usual manner.

Finally, our boundary descriptions of closed universes indicate that for small but finite $G_N$ there should exist a semiclassical description of a macroscopic closed universe, rather than a one-dimensional Hilbert space, and we discuss weaknesses in arguments favoring the latter.",Hong Liu,2025/9/17,2025/9/17,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc']"

Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state.

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models.

We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.",Tianyuan Zhu,2025/9/16,2025/9/23,,N/A,['cond-mat.mtrl-sci']

Previous photometric work has revealed that the cores of these galaxies are redder than their outskirts. However, spectroscopy is needed to break the age-metallicity degeneracy and uncover the driver of these colour gradients. Here, we derive age and elemental abundance gradients for 8 distant ($1.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.2$), massive ($10.3\lesssim\log({\rm M}_*/{\rm M}_\odot)\lesssim 11.1$), quiescent galaxies, by fitting full-spectrum models to ultra-deep NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy from the JWST-SUSPENSE survey. We find that these galaxies have negative age, positive [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], and flat [Fe/H] gradients, implying that galaxy cores are older and Mg-deficient compared to galaxy outskirts. The age gradients indicate inside-out quenching, while the Mg-deficient cores suggest rapid gas expulsion as the central quenching mechanism. Thus, galaxy cores formed faster and quenched more efficiently than their outskirts. In this scenario, however, our [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients are still puzzling. Our results contrast lower-redshift studies, which find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients and negative metallicity gradients. Additionally, we find a positive trend between age gradients and rotational support, and marginal trends between gradients and galaxy velocity dispersions and ages. We discuss our findings in the context of galaxy growth scenarios, including minor mergers and progenitor bias, and the possible occurrence of different quenching mechanisms across redshift.

The conventional theory of superconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the Meissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus, rooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there are questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field expulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a reductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be resolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory, namely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition process. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where motion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We review how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer between electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge motion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications regarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to search for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures. Therefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important.",J. E. Hirsch,2025/9/14,2025/10/22,,N/A,['cond-mat.supr-con']

The continuous EL is maintained by the cycle of NV0 ground (GNV0),NV+ metastable (MNV+) and NV0 excited state (ENV0). The weaker EL intensity compared to photoluminescence (PL) is explained by the bottleneck transition from MNV+ to ENV0 and another non-luminescent transition cycle.

Similarly, for Pips we prove that deciding whether a puzzle has a solution is NP-Complete even in some restricted classes of instances.

These sources, dubbed ``Little Red Dots'' or LRDs, have been the subject of intense inquiry in the literature. Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive black holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has significant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of the difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive their rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide signatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that uniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we report the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the existence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the first 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a possible [FeVII]. Additionally, we report on the properties of significant Balmer absorption and find that the small widths and relative depths of the absorption feature suggest the source of the absorber is at or beyond the outer edge of the broad-line region and does it fully cover the accreting SMBH in the center of the system. The detection of these iron features, coupled with the properties of the Balmer absorption, unveils an alternative scenario for LRDs -- one where there are direct sight-lines from the accretion disk to gas on scales at (or beyond) the broad-line gas region.",Erini Lambrides,2025/9/11,2025/9/11,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']

However, AdS-Schwarzschild black holes continue to exist at low temperatures as complex saddle points. We point out that the real part of the on-shell action of these complex black holes is smaller than that of thermal AdS at the lowest temperatures, in AdS$_5$ and higher dimensions. So, naïvely, they should be the ""dominant"" saddles. This raises a puzzle: if these complex black holes were indeed the relevant saddle points, the physics of the bulk and that of the dual gauge theory would completely disagree at low temperatures. Using a mini-superspace approximation and contour arguments, we argue that these complex black holes do not actually contribute to the gravitational path integral, regardless of the value of their on-shell action. So the standard conclusion that thermal AdS is the correct saddle at the lowest temperatures continues to hold. We also comment on two related matters: whether the Kontsevich-Segal criterion is useful in this setting, and whether the unstable small black hole contributes to the path integral in the high-temperature phase.",Raghu Mahajan,2025/9/10,2025/9/10,,N/A,['hep-th']

In a wide binary, the acceleration of a proto-WD exerts a torque, modifying the orbital eccentricity. Potential signatures of this effect have been detected in Gaia's astrometric binary sample. At the same time, an AGB star's puffy envelope facilitates strong tidal interactions in binaries with periapsis separations of a few AU, capturing the companion into a tighter orbit and potentially driving the system towards a common-envelope phase. Using an analytical model for wide binary evolution under asymmetric AGB mass loss, we find that recoil can induce tidal interactions in up to $30\%$ of initially wide binaries on the AGB or post-AGB for initial separations of $\sim 100 \mbox{--} 1000$ AU. We relate these interactions to three recent observational puzzles: (i) The dearth of wide WD+MS and WD+WD binaries in Gaia DR3 with eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.9$. (ii) The formation of moderately eccentric WD+MS and WD+WD binaries with orbital periods of $\sim 100 \mbox{--} 1000$ days, which may happen via a high-eccentricity common-envelope phase.

In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such an unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed holons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase (LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase coherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like responses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations described by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external electromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the SC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $π$ phase shift with a substantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher temperatures.",Xiang Li,2025/9/10,2025/9/10,,N/A,"['cond-mat.str-el', 'cond-mat.supr-con']"

In this work, we perform a comprehensive stacking analysis of NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We report clear evidence for hot-dust emission in the median stacked spectral energy distribution (SED), featuring a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $λ_{\rm rest}$$\sim$~3$μ$m, which is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. Although LRDs are likely a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most ($\gtrsim$50\%) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep Chandra stacks, suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$>$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc). Therefore, we argue that AGN-heated dust does not directly obscure either the Optical/UV continuum or the broad-line region emission, in order to explain the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. While a gas-dust displacement is in line with several models, the formation scenario (in-situ or ex-situ) of this pre-enriched hot dust remains unclear.",I.

This generic possibility also has concrete motivation in particle physics models which invoke a multitude of vacua to address theoretical puzzles. The naïve constraint on such an event comes from measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, but this can only probe transitions involving $\mathcal{O}(10)\%$ of the dark energy. In this work, we show that significantly tighter constraints appear when accounting for phase transition fluctuations affecting CMB photon propagation anisotropically, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. For instance, if a completed phase transition has $β/H_\star\lesssim 25$, current CMB data limits the associated vacuum energy released to less than $1\%$ of the dark energy. A transition to negative vacuum energy (quasi-anti-de Sitter) is allowed only for $β/H_\star \gtrsim 300$.

I propose instead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near gravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly non-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field engage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity, achieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is dominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime and enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through singularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions, fails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By contrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted i(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional component of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the empirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking new phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes (on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the classical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black hole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant generalizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string theory, and unified models of fundamental interactions.

By tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment interaction, Orchestrator mitigates the effects of partial observability and enables agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently.

Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance.

2509.04743v1,Integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity stabilizes cooperator-defector coexistence in N-player giving games,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04743v1,"Human cooperation persists among strangers despite theoretical predictions of difficulties in large, well-mixed populations, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study N-player giving games with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (X), unconditional defection (Y), and an integrated reciprocal strategy (Z) combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of unconditional defectors and integrated reciprocators whenever the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a threshold (b/c > 2). Counterintuitively, introducing small complexity costs, rather than destabilizing, stabilizes the equilibrium by preventing not only unconditional cooperators (viewed as second-order freeloaders) but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. While the equilibrium frequency of integrated reciprocators decreases with group size N, it remains positive for any finite N. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. Defectors serve as ""evolutionary shields"" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward chains and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.",Tatsuya Sasaki,2025/9/5,2025/9/5,,N/A,"['q-bio.PE', 'cs.CY', 'nlin.AO', 'physics.soc-ph']"

These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and (2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics. We find that prompts that more clearly align with (gender bias) evaluation framing elicit distinct gender output distributions compared to less evaluation-framed prompts. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ""testing mode"" performance, and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.",Bufan Gao,2025/9/4,2025/9/10,,N/A,['cs.CL']

By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $Γ$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field.

2509.03938v1,TopoSculpt: Betti-Steered Topological Sculpting of 3D Fine-grained Tubular Shapes,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03938v1,"Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies. Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii) first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $β_{0}$ errors are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy.

Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments"", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose Hierarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. Our extensive experiments validate that HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, and offer deep insights into how reasoning advances through the lens of strategic exploration.",Haozhe Wang,2025/9/3,2025/9/27,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL']"

In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle by introducing a weaker locality principle, ""disjoint additivity"", which together with Haag duality should always be satisfied in local quantum systems. As evidence, we give examples in which disjoint additivity is preserved when ordinary additivity is violated; we show that Haag duality and disjoint additivity are satisfied in rather general lattice systems with local symmetry constraints; we give examples of nonlocal theories in which either disjoint additivity or Haag duality is violated; and finally we give examples of systems with nonlocal symmetry constraints in which disjoint additivity is violated, but can be restored by passing to a local ""SymTFT"" system in one higher dimension.",Daniel Harlow,2025/9/3,2025/9/3,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'cond-mat.str-el', 'math.OA', 'quant-ph']"

This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of $\sim27.68$ and a sharp $>3$ mag flux drop between $3.5{-}4.5\,μ$m, undetected below $3.5\,μ$m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests $z\geq15$ as well as $z<10$ dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at $z\sim32$, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only $\sim0.5\%$ of the posterior volume at $z<25$. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at $z<10$, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}<300\,\mathrm{K}$, $d\gtrsim130\,\mathrm{pc}$, up to $\sim2\,\mathrm{kpc}$).

At the same time, web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling. We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However, we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.",Abhinav Kumar,2025/9/1,2025/9/1,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']"

Existing explanations such as the ""Big Filter,"" ""Zoo Hypothesis,"" and ""Dark Forest"" theory are trapped in isolated frameworks of ""hypothesis list paradigm"" that resist falsification. This paper proposes the ""Recursive Panopticon Hypothesis"" arguing that under the uncertainty of recursive higher-order deterrence, cosmic civilizations will universally adopt ""silence"" as their optimal survival strategy through rational risk avoidance. To test this hypothesis, we innovatively introduce the interdisciplinary research paradigm of ""Computational Cosmic Sociology."" By constructing a highly parameterized Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulation, we abstract civilizations as rational agents with risk perception, strategy learning, and interactive memory evolving within a simulated cosmic grid. The model's core lies in a utility function based on recursive deterrence theory and a network co-evolution mechanism connecting micro-decisions with macro-social structures. Research findings indicate: ""Silence"" is an evolutionarily stable strategy; the ""Dark Forest"" state is merely a special case of system instability under extreme resource scarcity and high-density civilizations; civilizational interactions spontaneously form structured social networks with small-world properties; and a hypothetical ""Ultimate Civilization"" can effectively maintain order.

Such gradients pose a longstanding puzzle for models of planetary evolution and formation, which predict that vigorous convection would homogenize the interior of gas giants within the first $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{years}$ of cooling. Previous 3D simulations and analytic predictions for the propagation of a convection zone into a stable region have demonstrated that the rapid rotation of gas giants can significantly slow convective mixing, but not enough to stop it. Another piece of the puzzle is luminosity. Gas giants cool as they age, and with that comes a declining heat flux over time. Recent ideas suggest that when this declining luminosity is combined with rotational effects, convection may stall. We explore this possibility using 3D hydrodynamic simulations that include both rotation and a surface cooling flux that decreases as $1/t$. Our results demonstrate that, even without rotation, a declining luminosity can suppress mixing sufficiently to preserve an initial compositional gradient in the deep interior of gas giants. If confirmed by more realistic simulations, this may help to explain the long-term survival of fuzzy cores.",Shu Zhang,2025/8/30,2025/9/3,,N/A,['astro-ph.EP']

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states, and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+, where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+ state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH, constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or ``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+.

Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.",R.

2508.20240v1,Low-ionization structures in planetary nebulae -- IV. The molecular hydrogen counterpart,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20240v1,"Context. Low-ionization structures (LISs), found in all morphological types of planetary nebulae (PNe), are small-scale features prominent in emission from low-ionization species such as [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [O i]. Observational and theoretical efforts have aimed to better understand their origin and nature. Recently, the detection of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission associated with LISs in a few PNe has added a new piece to the puzzle of understanding these nebular structures. Aims. Although observational studies indicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their host PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures. The detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the observations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with already known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope. A narrow band filter, centered on H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 $μ$m emission line, was used along with a continuum filter, to ensure continuum subtraction. Results. We present a deep, high-angular resolution near-IR narrowband H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) imaging survey of five Galactic PNe with LISs. We nearly double the sample of LISs detected in the H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 $μ$m emission line as well as the number of host PNe. These findings allows us to prove that the systematically lower electron density in LISs --relative to the rims and shells of their host nebulae-- is linked to the presence of H2 molecular gas. Additionally, we provide the first estimation of the excited H$_2$ molecular mass in LISs, which is found between 200 and 5000 times lower than the corresponding ionized gas mass.",M. B.

We investigate how the ultra-long period of ASKAP J1935+2148 is evolved by the braking of relativistic particle wind, in a time scale of about 0.1 - 1 Myr, from a normal pulsar with local superstrong magnetic fields. In addition, it is noticed that the ULPPs in the period versus period derivative diagram are much below the ``death line"", implying their different characteristics from the normal pulsars. Five sources (including ASKAP J1935+2148) in total eight ULPPs share the rotational energy loss rates to be lower than their respective radio emission luminosities, a phenomenon that can be accounted for by the sustainable radio bursts induced through the reconnection of locally concentrated magnetic field lines.The diversity and complexity of ULPP radio emissions should be closely related to the presence of magnetic reconnection rather than rotational powered discharges in the gaps. Furthermore, it is suggested that the coherent radio emissions of pulsars may have two origins, one from the rotation-powered electric voltage that accounts for the normal pulsar phenomena and the other from the magnetic reconnection-induced continual radio bursts that account for the ULPP observations.",Zhi-Yao Yang,2025/8/27,2025/8/27,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.SR']"

Recent observational studies found that the radial distributions of the first (P1) and second population (P2) differ in dynamically-young GCs. Since P2 is conventionally assumed to form more centrally concentrated, the rapid mixing (or even inversion) in some GCs but not others is puzzling. We investigate whether dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might cause this. Specifically, we evaluate the expansion of P2 by binary-single interactions in the cluster core and whether these can mix the P1/P2 radial distributions, using a set of toy-models with varying numbers and masses of primordial binaries. We find that even one massive binary star can push the central P2 outwards, but multiple binaries are required to fully mix P1 and P2 within a few relaxation times. We also compare our results to observed properties of mixed young GCs (NGC 4590, 5053, or 5904).",Václav Pavlík,2025/8/27,2025/8/27,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']

The same holds for rows, columns, and blocks in Sudokus. Summing the elements of a unit yields a linear equation, and the set of all such equations forms a system of linear equations that models the relations of the variables in Latin squares and Sudoku puzzles. Every completed Latin square or Sudoku satisfies this system, enabling analysis and completion of partially filled puzzles. The linear system provides necessary but not sufficient conditions for a solution. We analyze the structure and rank of these systems and establish limits on their ability to uniquely determine solutions. For Latin squares of size $n \times n$ with $k$ unknowns and Sudokus with block size $n = m \cdot l$, the system has full rank only if \[ k \leq 2n - 1 \quad \text{(Latin squares)}, \qquad k \leq 2n - 1 + (l - 1)(m - 1) \quad \text{(Sudokus)}. \] These conditions are necessary for uniqueness under the linear model, though counterexamples exist. We also highlight that this system captures only one of the three relations known to puzzle solvers, requiring extensions with additional (nonlinear) constraints for complete solutions. Our analysis shows that certain partial Latin squares and Sudokus can be solved in polynomial time using Gaussian elimination, placing them in complexity class P, while the general completion problem remains NP-complete.",Ralf Pöppel,2025/8/26,2025/8/26,,N/A,['math.GM']

However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art networks.

Our diffusion-based pipeline adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the diffusion reasoner's policy.

Our approach features three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction mechanism.

SPD strongly reduce the pressure required for PTs/CRs (by one-two orders of magnitude) and PT hysteresis; lead to hidden metastable phases, which cannot be obtained otherwise, and substitute reversible PTs/CRs with irreversible ones. This review is devoted to breakthroughs in understanding multifaceted interactions between high-pressure PTs/CRs, SPD, and microstructure evolution from the viewpoint of advanced mechanics and thermodynamics of materials under stress and plastic strain tensors. A novel concept of plastic strain-induced PTs/CRs under high pressure is explored using four-scale theory and simulations (from atomistic to nano- and scale-free phase-field approaches to macroscale) coupled to in situ experiments in traditional and rotational diamond anvil cells, and their integration.

2508.12119v2,Magnetars in Binaries as the Engine of Actively Repeating Fast Radio Bursts,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12119v2,"The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.",Bing Zhang,2025/8/16,2025/10/8,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.SR']"

Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English.

The theory accounts for the major facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal brains.

We show that the complexified exceptional Jordan algebra \(J_{3}(\mathbb{O}_{\mathbb{C}})\), the natural mathematical framework for the exceptional Lie group \(E_{6}\), provides a unified explanation for both. In this approach, the three generations arise from the three canonical eigenvalues of Jordan elements, while their mass hierarchies are determined by a minimal, universal ladder in the \(\mathrm{Sym}^{3}(\mathbf{3})\) representation of a flavor \(SU(3)\) subgroup.  The construction yields several parameter-free predictions. The universal Jordan eigenvalue spectrum \((q-δ, q, q+δ)\) is fixed by the algebra to have a spread \(δ^{2}=3/8\). The requirement of a minimal, consistent ladder uniquely selects fixed Clebsch-Gordan factors \((2,1,1)\) for state mixing. Together, these inputs derive closed-form expressions for the square-root mass ratios of all charged fermions (quarks and leptons) from a single underlying structure. A Dynkin \(\mathbb{Z}_{2}\) automorphism of \(E_{6}\) (a ``swap'') naturally relates the down-quark and charged-lepton sectors, predicting \(\sqrt{m_τ/m_μ} = \sqrt{m_{s}/m_{d}}\). The first-generation mass scale is set by a trace split \(\operatorname{Tr}X_{\ell}:\operatorname{Tr}X_{u}:\operatorname{Tr}X_{d}=1:2:3\), leading to the relation \(\sqrt{m_{e}}:\sqrt{m_{u}}:\sqrt{m_{d}}=1:2:3\).",Tejinder P.

High initial uncertainty drives engagement in dominance, reproduction, and care; as visibility solidifies the hierarchy over the generations, uncertainty vanishes, nullifying perceived gains from social activities.

For binaries containing a white dwarf, we find a complex dependence of the wide binary fraction on the white dwarf mass, including a steep decline as a function of mass at >0.6Msun. Furthermore, we find that wide binaries containing white dwarfs have significantly lower eccentricities than main-sequence binaries at the same separations. To model these observations, we compute the effects of post-main-sequence mass loss on the orbital parameters of wide binaries in all regimes of timescales, from secular to impulsive, and incorporate this dynamics in a population synthesis model. We find that adiabatic expansion of the orbits in binaries with slow enough evolutionary processes is the most likely explanation for the puzzling eccentricity distribution of white dwarf wide binaries. The steeply declining white dwarf binary fraction as a function of mass requires that the timescale for mass loss must be significantly shorter for high-mass stars (10^3-10^4 years) than for the low-mass ones. We confirm previous studies that suggested that recoil in the range 0.25-4 km/s is required to explain the observed distribution of separations of white dwarf wide binaries. Finally, for low-mass white dwarfs (<0.5Msun), we see interesting signatures of their formation due to close binary evolution in their wide binary statistics.

The ``young'' vector meson hypothesis may explain the fact that the obtained scattering length value for the nucleon $φ$-meson compared to the typical hadron size of approximately $\sim1~\mathrm{fm}$ indicates that the proton is more transparent for the $φ$-meson compared to the $ω$-meson and is much less transparent than the $J/ψ$-meson.

If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.",Dmitry D.

On the other hand, the EPOS project is a theoretical global approach aiming at describing data from very fundamental electron-positron interactions to central heavy ions collisions. We will demonstrate that this approach can provide new constraints, changing the correlation between the measured data at mid-rapidity and the predicted particle production at large rapidities, which drive the EAS development. Thus, using the same accelerator data, different predictions are obtained in air shower simulations in much better agreement with the current air shower data (for both the maximum shower development depth Xmax and the energy spectrum of the muons at ground).

However, the underlying mechanisms by which such a straightforward approach overcomes the long-standing synthesis challenges of non-vdW 2D materials remains a puzzle. Here, we investigate the crystallization dynamics and phase evolution of Bi under vdW confinement through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations powered by a machine-learning force filed fine-tuned and distilled from a pre-trained model with DFT-level accuracy. We reveal that pressure-dependent layer modulation arises from a quantum confinement-driven anisotropic crystallization mechanism, in which out-of-plane layering occurs nearly two orders of magnitude faster than in-plane ordering. Two critical transitions are identified: an alpha-to-beta phase transformation at 1.64 GPa, and a subsequent collapse into a single-atomic layer at 2.19 GPa. The formation of large-area single crystals is enabled by substrate-induced orientational selection and accelerated grain boundary migration, driven by atomic diffusion at elevated temperatures. These findings resolve the mechanistic origin of high-quality 2D crystal growth under confinement and establish guiding principles for the controlled synthesis of metastable 2D single crystals, with implications for next-generation quantum and nanoelectronic devices.",Yuxiang Gao,2025/8/9,2025/8/9,,N/A,['cond-mat.mtrl-sci']

Assuming that the GRB ejecta is structured, we investigated this issue by characterizing the ejecta as an ultra-relativistic uniform jet core surrounded by a mild-relativistic cocoon. The mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region can accelerate particles through the shear acceleration mechanism. Parameterizing the radial velocity profile of the MJC region with an exponential function and assuming a uniform magnetic field configuration, we show that the synchrotron radiation of the shear-accelerated electrons can produce a bright optical flash. Emission of the self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) process of the electron population can result in an X-ray excess and an extra MeV-GeV gamma-ray flash relative to the Band function component in the keV-MeV band, which is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core.

CLAS data demonstrated that even precision data for unpolarized $φ$ photoproduction are insufficient to unambiguously extract $σ_{φN}$, allowing the possibilities of both $σ_{φN}$ values. However, as it often happens, the additional spin degrees of freedom afforded by a polarized target sufficiently constrains the theory to unambiguously provide $σ_{φN}$. This will be accomplished with a measurement of the tensor asymmetry $A_{zz}$ in coherent $φ$ photoproduction from the deuteron, $γ+ d \to φ+ d$. The same measurement in coherent $ρ$ photoproduction will allow us to understand the kinematic dependence of the photon longitudinal interaction length for this process, which is necessary to identify unambiguous signal for color transparency.

Our findings indicate that photospheric micro-turbulence is a genuine physical phenomenon rather than a modelling artifact. A direct comparison between observed micro-turbulent velocities and corresponding theoretical predictions for the turbulent pressure fraction strongly suggests that this phenomenon most likely arises from photospheric motions driven by envelope convection zones, with an additional pulsational component likely operating in main-sequence B stars. We show that neglecting micro-turbulent broadening in Fourier transform analyses can partly explain the dearth of slow rotators and the scarcity of stars with extremely low macro-turbulent velocity.

Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.

2508.02570v2,Neural Scaling Laws Surpass Chemical Accuracy for the Many-Electron Schrödinger Equation,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02570v2,"We demonstrate, for the first time, that neural scaling laws can deliver near-exact solutions to the many-electron Schrödinger equation across a broad range of realistic molecules. This progress is enabled by the Lookahead Variational Algorithm (LAVA), an effective optimization scheme that systematically translates increased model size and computational resources into greatly improved energy accuracy for neural network wavefunctions. Across all tested cases, including benzene, the absolute energy error exhibits a systematic power-law decay with respect to model capacity and computation resources. The resulting energies not only surpass the 1 kcal/mol ""chemical-accuracy"" threshold but also achieve 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy. Beyond energies, the scaled-up neural network also yields better wavefunctions with improved physical symmetries, alongside accurate electron densities, dipole moments, and other important properties. Our approach offers a promising way forward to addressing many long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry. For instance, we improve energetic properties for systems such as the potential energy curve of nitrogen dimer as dissociation is approached and the cyclobutadiene automerization reaction barrier, producing definitive benchmarks, particularly in regimes where experimental data are sparse or highly uncertain. We also shed light on the decades-old puzzle of the cyclic ozone stability with highly accurate calculations for the cyclic-to-open ozone barrier. These results provide near-exact reference calculations with unprecedented accuracy, universal reliability and practical applicability, establishing a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry.",Du Jiang,2025/8/4,2025/8/5,,N/A,"['physics.chem-ph', 'physics.comp-ph']"

Yet, when it comes to their interaction with the `real' side of the economy, existing scholarship has overlooked a critical feature of developing countries. They cannot trade in their national currencies and need US dollars to access modern production techniques as well as maintain consumption patterns similar to those of wealthier societies. To address this gap, we present a novel heterogeneous agents model from the perspective of a developing economy that distinguishes between speculative and non-speculative sectors in the FX market. We demonstrate that as long as non-speculative demand responds to domestic economic activity, a market-clearing output growth rate exists that, in steady-state, is equal to the ratio between FX supply growth and the income elasticity of demand for foreign assets, i.e., a generalised dynamic trade-multiplier. Numerical simulations reproduce key stylised facts of exchange rate dynamics and economic growth, including distributions that deviate from the typical bell-shaped curve. Data from a sample of Latin American countries reveal that FX fluctuations exhibit similar statistical properties. Furthermore, we employ time-varying parameter estimation techniques to show that the dynamic trade-multiplier closely tracks observed growth rates in these economies.",Marwil J.

To solve Sudokus with ONNs, we define a novel mapping strategy that utilizes the unique characteristics of the computation paradigm. The problem is encoded through a puzzle specific graph-embedding, which implements the constraints through different subgraphs. These subgraphs are then combined into a single adjacency matrix, which allows the natural dynamics of the phases of coupled oscillators to find a solution to the puzzle. We model the phase dynamics of the ONN by means of the Kuramoto differential equation. This novel approach is then compared to the well-established iterative method to solve Sudoku already used in binary Hopfield networks (HNN). Solving optimization problems typically requires a large amount of energy to solve on conventional hardware. Therefore, we are motivated to explore the mapping of Sudoku from a theoretical point of view to establish the validity of this approach.

A promising explanation is the $νp$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $νp$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $νp$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $νp$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.",Alexander Friedland,2025/8/4,2025/8/4,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'hep-ph', 'nucl-th']"
2508.01737v1,"An analytical framework for the Levine hats problem: new strategies, bounds and generalizations",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01737v1,"We study the Levine hat problem, a classic combinatorial puzzle introduced by Lionel Levine in 2010. This problem involves a game in which $n \geq 2$ players, each seeing an infinite stack of hats on each of their teammates' heads but not on their own, must simultaneously guess the index of a black hat on their own stack. If one of the players fails to do so, the team loses collectively. The players must therefore come up with a good strategy before the game starts. While the optimal winning probability $V_{n}$ remains unknown even for $n=2$, we make three key advances. First, we develop a novel geometric framework for representing strategies through measurable functions, providing a new expression of $V_{n}$ and a unified treatment of the game for finite and for infinite stacks via integral formulations. Secondly, we construct a new strategy $K_{5}$ that reaches the conjectured optimal probability of victory : $0.35$. We also show that $K_{5}$ is part of a larger class of strategies that allow us to improve current bounds and resolve conjectured inequalities. Finally, we introduce and entirely solve a continuous generalization of the problem, demonstrating that extending to uncountable hat stacks increases the optimal winning probability to exactly $1/2$. This generalization naturally leads to a broader and smoother strategic framework, within which we also describe how to compute optimal responses to a range of strategies.",Clément Bouquet,2025/8/3,2025/8/3,,N/A,"['math.CO', 'math.PR']"

In response, studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing.

In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.",Shiro Sakai,2025/8/2,2025/8/2,,N/A,['cond-mat.str-el']

Doubt is cast on this assumption by what appears, at first glance, to be a reasonable candidate for a quantum system that is not naturally represented by any algebra. To resolve this puzzle, this work draws inspiration from recent frameworks for causal modelling in quantum theory to propose a ""causal view"" of quantum systems. The causal view defines quantum systems purely in terms of the causal structure of the unitary dynamics. The algebraic representation of quantum systems is derived from the causal view: it is proven that every quantum system corresponds to a unique von Neumann algebra of operators. The causal view is extended with a definition of a ""classical quantum system"" inspired by quantum Darwinism. It is shown that such a system corresponds to a unique commutative von Neumann operator algebra, completing the derivation of the traditional algebraic approach to quantum systems from the causal view.

We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits. Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of ``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.",Pilsung Kang,2025/8/1,2025/8/14,,N/A,"['quant-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech']"

Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z > 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$α$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}>10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$.

Their two-dimensional derivatives, formed by inserting organic spacer molecules between perovskite layers, were expected to follow well-established trends seen in Pb-based 2D perovskites, namely, increasing exciton binding energies with decreasing layer thickness due to enhanced quantum and dielectric confinement. However, recent experimental and computational studies have revealed anomalous behavior in Ag/Bi-based 2D perovskites, where this trend is reversed. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation frameworks, we resolve this puzzle by systematically comparing experimental structures with idealized models designed to isolate the effects of octahedral distortions, interlayer separation, and stacking. We find that structural distortions, driven by directional Ag d orbital bonding, govern the momentum-space origin and character of the exciton, and are the primary cause of the observed non-monotonic trends. Furthermore, we explore how interlayer distance and stacking influence band gaps and exciton binding energies, showing that, despite different chemistry, the underlying confinement physics mirrors that of Pb-based 2D perovskites.

Rock records show that this magnetic field has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y). However, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core of less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a puzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth and the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core dynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the mantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little attention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO above a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner core days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of several dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh number, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient ratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can easily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately linear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square velocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\Nu_o-1)$, where $\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\Nu_o$ of order 1 to 10 considered.

We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06.

In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a ""top heavy"" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as $M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass could be lower by a factor of $\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with slope $α$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the numerical results, $ε(α) \approx ε_{\rm fid}e^{2.66(α-2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST: the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently high mass galaxies.",Joshua J.

This explains the proximity of the exotic hidden-heavy hadrons to heavy-hadron--pair thresholds, identifies the thresholds that support bound states or resonances, and prevents an explosion in the number of predicted states.

These structures are caused by refractive scattering and are separated by Airy minima. Their importance stems from their close relationship to the interaction potential between two $^{12}$C nuclei, which also describes the molecular resonances of the compound system at lower energies. Although a unique deep potential was usually determined from rainbow scattering at higher energies, a puzzling discrepancy persisted: the energy at which the Airy minimum $A1$ crosses 90$^\circ$ was $E_{c.m.}\approx$67 MeV for $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C. This is remarkably low compared to approximately 100 MeV for both the $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C and $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O systems. This question remained unanswered until the discovery of the secondary rainbow in the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C system. We report for the first time that the highest energy at which the dynamically generated Airy minimum of the secondary rainbow crosses 90$^\circ$ is about 100 MeV. This demonstrates that the fourth Airy elephant exists between the Airy minimum $A1$ of the primary nuclear rainbow and that, $A1^{(S)}$, of the secondary rainbow. The long-standing problem concerning the Airy minima and Airy elephants has finally been resolved after decades of concern by recognizing the existence of a dynamically generated secondary rainbow in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C scattering.",S.

Strangely, despite the tininess of the ordered polarization, the ferroelectricity survives up to 350 K, rendering the mechanism of such ferroelectricity challenging for standard understandings.

This unusual low-energy correlation, which emerges from an antiferroelectric structure formed at much higher energy, naturally explains the above puzzling observation. This result reveals an unprecedented paradigm of electronic ferroelectricity generally applicable to 2D polar metals with ultrafast-switchable polarization ideal for the next-generation non-volatile memory and other devices.",Fangyuan Gu,2025/7/24,2025/7/24,,N/A,"['cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.str-el']"

Using a proprietary dataset encompassing patent records, R&D expenditures, capital valuation, and firm performance from 2020 to 2024, we examine whether and how innovation, measured by patents and R&D input, translates into economic output. Contrary to established literature, we find that patent output does not significantly contribute to either income or profit among the sampled firms. Further investigation reveals that patents may primarily serve a signaling function to external investors and policymakers, rather than reflecting true innovative productivity. In contrast, R&D expenditure shows a consistent and positive association with firm performance. Through mechanism analysis, we explore three channels (organizational environment, employee quality, and policy-driven incentives) to explain the impact of R&D, identifying capital inflow and valuation as key drivers of R&D investment. Finally, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effects of R&D are more pronounced in sub-industries such as smart terminals and digital creativity, and for firms based in Shenzhen. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that patent output is a universal indicator of innovation success and underscore the context-dependent nature of innovation-performance linkages in emerging markets.",Victor,2025/7/24,2025/7/24,,N/A,['econ.GN']

Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g., [Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools, Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts across all levels of task complexity.

A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17512v1,"Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance.

Using two distinct methods that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites, the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty levels.

These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field.

Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.

A key puzzle is whether the shear-induced polarization is non-dissipative or not. In this work, we analyzed the shear-induced polarization and the anomalous Hall effects using the entropy flow and H-theorem introduced from quantum (chiral) kinetic theory. While the shear-induced polarization and the anomalous Hall effect do not directly contribute to the entropy production rate, the perturbations associated with the shear tensor lead to an increase in entropy, similar to the role of the shear tensor in classical kinetic theory. We also examined these effects within the framework of linear response theory using Zubarev's approach. The analysis of time-reversal transformation on the spin current in coordinate space suggests that shear-induced polarization violates time-reversal symmetry and, therefore, should vanish. However, a similar analysis of the Wigner function in phase space does not impose any additional constraints on shear-induced polarization, allowing it to persist in phase space as expected. This discussion indicates that time-reversal analysis in coordinate space alone may not be sufficient to determine whether an effect is dissipative. Furthermore, our analysis based on Zubarev's approach suggests that these effects may indeed possess a dissipative nature. These findings highlight the limitations of the current theoretical framework in fully characterizing the dissipative properties of these phenomena.",Jia-Rong Wang,2025/7/21,2025/7/21,,N/A,"['hep-ph', 'hep-th', 'nucl-th']"

Existing multimodal unified representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization. CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set tasks.

The flexibility of the MSDSP model captures the possibility of zero coefficients (sparsity), constant coefficient (dynamic shrinkage), as well as sudden and gradual parameter movements (structural change) in the time-varying parameter model setting. We also apply MSDSP in the context of Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS) (McAlinn and West, 2019), where dynamic combination schemes exploit the information from the alternative economic models.

We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the neutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion. We find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary separation is less than about 20 Rsun. This is because the stellar radius expands beyond this radius before the shock-inflated envelope undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction back to the main sequence. We then consider the internal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks efficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to inverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much larger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is periodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate non-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100 MeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of the supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year. Photo-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen recombination lines. We then use the model to explain the puzzling Type Ic supernova SN2022jli which shows a double-peaked optical lightcurve along with many peculiar properties, including delayed onset and rapid shutoff of the second peak, periodic modulations, delayed GeV emission, and narrow Balmer lines. Under this model, SN2022jli had a close-by companion at a pre-supernova binary separation of 10 to 20 Rsun, likely due to an earlier phase of common-envelope evolution.",Wenbin Lu,2025/7/18,2025/7/18,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.SR']"

Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations.

Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.",Mohammad Shahab Sepehri,2025/7/16,2025/7/16,,N/A,['cs.CV']
2507.11916v2,A Parallel CPU-GPU Framework for Batching Heuristic Operations in Depth-First Heuristic Search,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11916v2,"The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search algorithms. This hardware has been exploited in best-first search algorithms with neural network-based heuristics by creating batched versions of A* and Weighted A* that delay heuristic evaluation until sufficiently many states can be evaluated in parallel on the GPU. But, research has not addressed how depth-first algorithms like IDA* or Budgeted Tree Search (BTS) can have their heuristic computations batched. This is more complicated in a tree search, because progress in the search tree is blocked until heuristic evaluations are complete. In this paper we show that GPU parallelization of heuristics can be effectively performed when the tree search is parallelized on the CPU while heuristic evaluations are parallelized on the GPU. We develop a parallelized cost-bounded depth-first search (CB-DFS) framework that can be applied to both IDA* and BTS, significantly improving their performance. We demonstrate the strength of the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and the 4x4 sliding tile puzzle (STP) with both classifier-based and regression-based heuristics.",Ehsan Futuhi,2025/7/16,2025/11/16,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.DC']"

We use maps from the Ly$α$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which trace the distributions of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and IGM Ly$α$ absorption on $\simeq 4$ $h^{-1}$ cMpc scales within the same large volume. Overall, the joint distribution of IGM absorption and LBG density is well constrained and accurately described by a simple physical model. However, we identify several exceptional locations exhibiting strong IGM absorption indicative of a massive protocluster, yet no coincident overdensity of LBGs. As discussed by Newman et al., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are candidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy populations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up observations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended region of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected protoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \times 10^{15}~M_{\odot}$. Ly$α$ emitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the candidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no submillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is needed to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with reduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and puzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers, whose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of environment-dependent galaxy evolution.",Andrew B.

Using product-level data from a supermarket in Sweden, we examine the relationship between front-of-package climate impact scores and retail prices, controlling for product size, nutritional content, and fixed effects. Contrary to the intuitive expectation of a positive green premium, we find no evidence that climate-friendly products are priced higher. In some product categories, products with better climate scores are in fact associated with lower prices, suggesting a negative premium, an outcome that gives rise to what we refer to as the green premium puzzle. We argue that market frictions such as competing consumer priorities, psychological distance from climate issues, and skepticism toward environmental labeling may suppress the price signals intended to reward sustainable consumption. These findings offer important insights for producers, retailers, and policymakers seeking to align climate goals with effective market incentives in the transition toward a more sustainable society.",Voraprapa Nakavachara,2025/7/14,2025/7/14,,N/A,['econ.GN']

Motivated by higher male infant mortality and the tendency to try again after a child's death, our model allows different continuation probabilities after sons and daughters. We find that a stable sex ratio at birth (SRB) differing from 1:1 can arise when these continuation probabilities differ. However, the sex ratio among last-born children (SRLB) always converges to 1:1. We mathematically prove that this 1:1 SRLB is an evolutionarily stable strategy under a new fitness measure based on the number of offspring in successful mating pairs, rather than the number of descendants in the whole population. Our results generalize Fisher's principle by showing that equilibrium is maintained at the level of last births even when the overall SRB is biased. This offers a potential explanation for the persistent slight male bias in human births, linking it to sex-specific child mortality and parental reproductive strategies in historical populations.",Nahyeon Lee,2025/7/14,2025/7/14,,N/A,"['physics.soc-ph', 'physics.bio-ph']"

However, most existing approaches fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric properties one encounters in real-life puzzles.

In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial) approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task.

2507.08686v1,Forget Me Not: Fighting Local Overfitting with Knowledge Fusion and Distillation,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08686v1,"Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected. This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice. But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent phenomenon.  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing performance without added inference cost.  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference complexity.",Uri Stern,2025/7/11,2025/7/11,,N/A,['cs.LG']

The observation that many black holes have reached supermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion models are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the physics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically thick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides the radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of the inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section drops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite being Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section calculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time drops by up to $47\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ black hole can form from a seed $10 M_{\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of accretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a number of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in that it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and cosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black holes have grown rapidly despite that limit.",Jackson Frangos,2025/7/11,2025/7/11,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.GA']"

In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors.

2507.07981v2,Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981v2,"Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.",Noam Razin,2025/7/10,2025/10/16,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"

Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted.

2507.07500v1,Pseudogap in a crystalline insulator doped by disordered metals,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07500v1,"A key to understand how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber (k). Even in the phase of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous solid), the coherent part of electron waves still possesses a band structure. Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more than 5 decades ago, but thus far, bandstructure renormalization and pseudogap induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here, we report the observation of this unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back towards zero k with the pseudogap of 30-240 meV from the Fermi level. This is k renormalization caused by resonance scattering that leads to the formation of quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth of this potential tuned by different kinds of alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) allows to classify the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance.

This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a broad set of such ""easy"" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks, including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the unpuzzles dataset, a different ""easy"" benchmark consisting of trivialized versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply improved performance.",Alan Malek,2025/7/9,2025/7/9,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"

This work aims to reconcile these seemingly contradictory facts by (1) analyzing the complexity of the inference problem for Nonogram (the problem of determining if there exists a puzzle parameter that can be inferred from the constraints without guessing) and (2) experimentally establishing the existence of a phase transition behavior for this inference problem. Our results show that the difficulty of the inference problem is largely determined by the density of filled cells (positive parameters) in a given puzzle.

Half-integer $κ/κ_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $κ$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can ""screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian.

TNOs are remnants of the planets' formation from a disc of gas and dust, so it is puzzling that they move mostly on eccentric orbits inclined to the planetary plane and show a complex red-to-grey colour distribution. A close stellar flyby can account for the TNOs' dynamics, but it is unclear if this can also explain the correlation between their colours and orbital characteristics. Assuming an initial red-to-grey colour gradient in the disc, our numerical study finds that the spiral arms induced by the stellar flyby simultaneously lead to the observed TNOs' colour patterns and orbital dynamics. The combined explanation of these TNO properties strengthens the evidence for a close flyby of another star to the young Solar System. Our study predicts that (1) small TNOs beyond 60 au will mostly be grey, and (2) retrograde TNOs will lack the colour most common to high-inclination TNOs. The anticipated TNO discoveries by the Vera Rubin telescope will be able to test these predictions.

But the identification of groups, especially nearby ones, suffers from projection effects which in turn affect the purity of the sample. In X-rays, the position of the cluster can be given either by the peak of the emission, or by the full information content of the cluster image. Similarly, the optical center, or its member galaxies, can describe the optical counterpart. With the progress of numerical simulations, it is currently feasible to reproduce both the optical group membership assignment and the behavior of the group outskirts in X-rays, and therefore there is an opportunity to define a reproducible group identification procedure. We performed two-way matching between X-ray contours, drawn at a fixed surface brightness level corresponding to a baryonic overdensity of ~500, to the projected galaxy positions using a modified Hausdorff distance (MHD). We used the volume-limited SDSS group catalog to evaluate the purity and completeness of the procedure, maintaining the constant performance of the optical group finder with redshift. We find that an MHD of 0.631 Mpc provides 90% purity. This is a clear improvement over the methods that rely on the optical counterparts' distance and richness. We study the purity versus MHD and the completeness versus redshift and velocity dispersion. Over half of nearby groups have X-ray emission, even those with velocity dispersions as low as 200km/s; this has never previously been demonstrated. The bulk of these groups follow the same scaling relations as the groups with a small separation between the optical and X-ray centers, removing feedback as an explanation for the lack of matches in previous studies. Instead, the problem is caused by over-merging in the optical group catalog construction and source confusion in X-rays.",J. Kosowski,2025/7/8,2025/7/8,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.CO']"

However, recent work suggests that holographic maps should post-select on such closed universes, and we argue that this is consistent with the extrapolate dictionary. We therefore construct a new holographic map for bulk states with baby universes and use this to show that the swap test cannot distinguish between Antonini and Rath's two candidate bulk duals.

Mechanisms proposed to explain the Li-Dip include effects related to rotation, magnetic fields, diffusion, gravity waves, and mass loss. The critical question became, which, if any, might be realistic? Here we show that mixing due to shear induced by stellar angular momentum loss is the unique mechanism driving the Li depletion. Each mechanism leaves a different signature in the subsurface Li distribution. The deepening surface convection zones of subgiants of NGC 188 evolving out of the Li-Dip dredge up the sub-surface material and thus reveal the signature of the responsible mechanism, rotation. Beryllium and boron data have also favored rotational mixing; however, these elements can be extremely difficult or impossible to observe. Our highly complementary approach provides fresh and very feasible perspectives on using Li to probe poorly understood physical mechanisms acting below the stellar surface, thereby improving fundamental understanding of stellar evolution. Rotational mixing may be the dominant mechanism that depletes Li in a wide range of Solar-type stars, including in the Sun. Possible connections to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis are discussed.",Qinghui Sun,2025/7/6,2025/8/30,,N/A,['astro-ph.SR']
2507.03960v2,Nested economies of scale in global city mass,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03960v2,"A longstanding puzzle in urban science is whether there's an intrinsic match between human populations and the mass of their built environments. Previous findings have revealed various urban properties scaling nonlinearly with population, yet existing models of city built mass are still dominated by per-capita linear thinking. Our analysis of >3,000 cities globally reveals universal sublinear scaling of city mass with population at both the city (\{beta}=0.90) and neighborhood levels (δ=0.75). This means that larger cities and denser neighborhoods achieve economies of scale with less per-capita built mass. Our theoretical framework further shows that city-level scaling emerges naturally from within-city disparities. This multi-scale understanding redefines ""over-built"" and ""under-built"" conditions as deviations from expected scaling patterns, implying either excessive environmental impacts or inadequate living standards. Effective urban policy thus requires moving beyond simple per-capita assumptions, adopting scale-adjusted metrics and managing cities as nested, complex systems.",Kangning Huang,2025/7/5,2025/8/8,,N/A,"['physics.soc-ph', 'nlin.AO']"

We also find a shorter 24-move sequence whose repetition yields a 2-cycle cover, which can be spliced into a Hamiltonian path. These constructions arise naturally from a general method: lifting Hamiltonian cycles from a quotient graph under the action of the puzzle's symmetry group.  The method produces compact, human-readable cycle encodings and appears effective in broader settings, suggesting a combinatorial grammar underlying Hamiltonian paths in symmetric configuration spaces.",Taizo Sadahiro,2025/7/5,2025/11/13,,N/A,['math.CO']
2507.03741v1,Evaluating an Embryo Origin for Detached TNOs within Full Kuiper Belt Formation Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03741v1,"With perihelia well beyond Neptune, but semimajor axes and eccentricities indicative of substantial perturbation, the origins of detached trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) remain a dynamical puzzle. In particular, detached TNOs with orbital inclinations below ~25 degrees are not easily generated from any known mechanism currently in the modern solar system. One notable hypothesis for the origins of detached TNOs is that a ~Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryo detached the perihelia of these objects from Neptune during the process of Kuiper belt formation before the embryo itself was ejected. We numerically model this scenario via simulations of Kuiper belt formation from a primordial planetesimal belt that is dispersed through the migration of the giant planets. In addition to ~100,000 Kuiper belt objects, each of our simulations contains a hypothetical population of embryos in the primordial belt. We find that our embryos are unlikely to reach the high-perihelion, large semimajor axis orbit necessary to efficiently detach TNO perihelia from Neptune's influence. Moreover, embryos will typically take at least 100 Myrs to reach these unlikely orbits, at which point most of the primordial belt will have already been ejected by the planets, limiting the available population that can be detached. Finally, the TNOs that our embryos do detach consistently have a semimajor axis distribution that is more biased toward small values than observed detached TNOs have. Thus, we conclude that planetary embryos in the primordial Kuiper belt are not likely to have been the primary mechanism for the origin of detached TNOs.",Nathan A.

Interestingly, the spectrum follows a power-law function continuing up to 0.8 PeV as reported by LHAASO, and the morphology of the emission appears a puzzling elongated structure. In this work, we propose that the elongated UHE emission from V4641 Sgr could originate from the inverse Compton radiation of electrons with a very hard spectrum, which may result from shear acceleration mechanism in the jets driven by V4641 Sgr. We also calculate the corresponding X-ray synchrotron emission from the same electron population, predicting the potential range of non-thermal X-ray flux of the source. The recent observation by XRISM toward the central part of the UHE source could pose a constraint on the model parameters. In the future, a full coverage of the source by sensitive X-ray instrument and high-resolution TeV-PeV gamma-ray instrument may provide a critical test of the model.",Su-Yu Wan,2025/7/3,2025/12/1,,N/A,['astro-ph.HE']

This ubiquity obscures an underlying question: why do societies designate certain individuals exclusively for the instruction of others? This question is especially enigmatic for dedicated teachers, who invest their labor in cultivating others' skills but do not directly participate in the productive activities for which their students are being trained. To address this puzzle, we develop a simple, mathematically tractable model of teaching and learning in a population with a shared goal. We identify a tradeoff between the size of the workforce and its collective level of expertise; and we analyze the optimal proportion of a population that should serve as teachers across a wide range of scenarios. We show that a population must exceed a critical size before it is beneficial to allocate anyone as a dedicated teacher at all. Subsequently, the peak demand for teachers is achieved at an intermediate population size, and it never surpasses one half of the population. For more complicated tasks, our analysis predicts the optimal allocation of teachers across different levels of expertise. The structure of this teacher allocation is more complex when the population size is large, in agreement with the general size-complexity hypothesis. Our account lays a foundation for understanding the adaptive advantage of dedicated teachers in both human and non-human societies.",Hirotaka Goto,2025/7/3,2025/7/3,,N/A,['q-bio.PE']
2507.01292v1,Hardness of Quantum Distribution Learning and Quantum Cryptography,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01292v1,"The existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in classical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum cryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer, provide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies $PP\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the analogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \neq NP$-has long been studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning in various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to $P \neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for OWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of OWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution learning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper quantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that follows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution learning can be derived from $PP \neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to average-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from $PP \neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if worst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite that, we show that $PP \neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of hardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \neq BQP$ if and only if agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard. As a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{Σ_3^P}$ learners implies $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$.",Taiga Hiroka,2025/7/2,2025/7/2,,N/A,"['quant-ph', 'cs.CC', 'cs.CR']"

By simulating diverse camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety.

Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o.

While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.",Zhihao Zhang,2025/6/30,2025/9/26,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']"

We wish to know whether there are inherent limits for the costs of such phenomena, and common units in which those can be traded off against more familiar costs measured in terms of heat dissipation. We give this problem a concrete framing in the context of CRNs, for the problem of extracting a topologically restricted pathway from a larger distributed network, through activation of some reactions and selective elimination of others. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a NESS, and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we make use of their formal equivalence to electrical circuits. We prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. For small CRNs, we show how catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms can drastically alter pathway costs, enabling unfavorable pathways to become favorable and approach the cost of the hosting pathway. Our results provide insights into the thermodynamic principles governing open CRNs and offer a foundation for understanding the evolution of metabolic networks.",Praful Gagrani,2025/6/30,2025/10/29,,N/A,"['q-bio.MN', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'nlin.AO']"

Computational simulation modeling by a genetic algorithm provides some answers.

Second, the extent of fitness-gain is greater when a higher fraction of the population is dormant; thus, the probability of species survival is greater for higher prevalence of dormancy. In sum, even when the environment is unfavorable initially and remains unchanged, sporadic dormancy enables a weak/rare species enhance the extent of favorable adaptation over time, successfully combating the forces of natural selection.",Sasanka Sekhar Chanda,2025/6/28,2025/6/28,,N/A,['q-bio.PE']

Similarities and differences in the morphological and the kinematical properties of the UDGs with their possible precursors, namely low-surface brightness (LSBs), L*-type high-surface brightness (HSBs) and dwarf galaxies, may provide crucial constraints on their origin and evolution. We selected samples of UDGs, LSBs, HSBs and dwarfs from TNG50-1. We first obtained a few possible scaling relations involving some mass properties to analyse if the regression fits for UDGs are in compliance with those of the other samples. Then, we studied individual galaxy cutouts to evaluate the intrinsic shapes of their dark-matter (DM) and stellar components, orbital and kinematical properties related to their stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we constructed the mock IFU data using the SimSpin code to extract the stellar kinematic moment maps. We observe that the UDGs and the dwarf galaxies have nearly similar regression fits in a. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs gas mass, b. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs total dynamical mass, c. stellar central surface density vs ratio of stellar-to-total dynamical mass, and d. total baryonic mass vs total dynamical mass parameter spaces. Next, we find that the isolated UDGs are prolate rotators similar to the dwarf population, while the tidally-bound UDGs can exhibit both prolate and oblate-rotating shapes. The DM and stellar velocity anisotropy properties of the UDGs suggest that they reside in a cored, dwarf-like halo and may be classified by early-type galaxies. Finally, the stellar kinematic properties suggest that both the UDGs and the dwarfs are slow-rotators having low to nearly no-rotations in contrast to the late-type, disc-dominated, fast-rotating LSBs and HSBs.

These UVdim stars predominantly lie on the blue MS, which is composed of slow rotators, and their distinct UV properties are believed to stem from dusty circumstellar disks. Although eMSTOs are common in both Magellanic Clouds and Galactic open clusters (OCs) of comparable ages, UVdim stars have not yet been investigated in Galactic OCs.

Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where flat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of these bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum space probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly image the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and energy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow the single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that are completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy electronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the interplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of striking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization, Mott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light particles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy sector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve the long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by showing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same topological heavy fermion-like flat bands.

Decoding the Origins of the G3425 Binary,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20386v1,"A binary system (G3425) consisting of a massive unseen component and a red giant star on a nearly circular orbit was recently discovered. The formation of such a system is puzzling because orbital stability generally breaks down due to the large mass loss from the system caused by the SN explosion while forming the unseen component. Analytical solutions of the variable-mass two-body problem suggest that the explosion should have occurred when the component was close to its apocenter to explain the near-circular remnant system. This provides a strong constraint on the total mass and orbital configuration of the progenitor system. The nearly circular orbit of G3425 rules out type II SN scenarios and allows only for a fine-tuned SN~Ib/c explosion to occur when the secondary was close to its apocenter. Such a scenario, although possible, is highly unlikely. However, the most likely scenario is a failed SN that produced a black hole, for which no additional constraints on the position of the secondary are needed. We propose that the unseen component of G3425 is a mass-gap black hole with a mass constrained between the theoretical minimum for failed supernova progenitors (4 MSun) and the observed upper limit (4.4 MSun).

We conclude that even for state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.",Fien van Wetten,2025/6/23,2025/6/23,,N/A,['cs.AI']

Evaluating Exploratory, Compositional, and Transformative Generalization",http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18880v1,"Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity: (1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3) Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency.",Yiyou Sun,2025/6/23,2025/6/23,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']"
2506.18957v1,A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957v1,"The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff, where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model, initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation, now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount. Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.",Sheraz Khan,2025/6/23,2025/6/23,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"

Yet, despite their widespread adoption, we lack a mechanistic model that provides these methods with a solid mathematical foundation. Here, we analytically derive the economic complexity eigenvector associated with a mechanistic model where the output of an economy in an activity (e.g. of a country in a product) depends on the combined presence of the factors required by the activity. Using analytical and numerical derivations we show that the economic complexity index (or ECI) is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is endowed with many factors, validating the idea that it is an agnostic estimate of the presence of multiple factors of production. We then generalize this result to other production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with prices, wages, and consumption, showing that the derived wage function is consistent with economies converging to an income that is compatible with their complexity. Finally, we use this model to explain differences in the networks of related activities, such as the product space and the research space, showing that the shape of these networks can be explained by different factor distributions. These findings solve long standing puzzles in the economic complexity literature and validate commonly used metrics of economic complexity as estimates of the combined presence of multiple factors.",César A.

2506.17397v1,Negative intrinsic viscosity in graphene nanoparticle suspensions induced by hydrodynamic slip,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17397v1,"The viscosity of nanoparticle suspensions is always expected to increase with particle concentration. However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions of atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation. Some experiments indicate effective suspension viscosity values that fall below that of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e., the intrinsic viscosity is negative. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, we combined molecular dynamics and boundary integral simulations to investigate the shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high Péclet numbers (Pe $> 100$). Our results, covering geometric aspect ratios from 4.5 to 12.0, show robustly that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing aspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold aspect ratio $\approx 5.5$. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface, which suppresses particle rotation and promotes stable alignment with the flow direction, thereby reducing viscous dissipation relative to dissipation in pure solvent. This slip mechanism holds for both fully 3D disc-like and quasi-2D particle geometries explored in the molecular simulations. As the concentration of graphene particles increases in the dilute regime, the viscosity initially decreases, falling below that of pure water. At higher concentrations, however, particle aggregation becomes significant, leading to a rise in viscosity after a minimum is reached. These findings confirm the occurrence of a negative intrinsic viscosity in a graphene suspension due only to hydrodynamic effects. Our work has important implications for the design of lubricants, inks, and nanocomposites with tunable viscosity.",Adyant Agrawal,2025/6/20,2025/6/20,,N/A,['cond-mat.soft']

Constraining the interaction parameter space through a combination of the latest astronomical observations and hypernuclear physics experiments is therefore essential. In this study, we incorporate experimental constraints from $Ξ$ hypernuclear physics on top of $Λ$ hyperons considered in \citet{Sun2023APJ942.55}. Specifically, based on updated measurements of hyperon separation energies from $Ξ$ hypernuclear experiments, sets of $ΞN$ effective interactions are constructed and a linear correlation between their scalar ($σ$) and vector ($ω$) coupling strength ratios is proposed as a constraint derived from $Ξ$ hypernuclear physics. Together with experimental correlations and astronomical observational data, four types of analyses are performed to constrain hyperon-nucleon interactions and the properties of hyperon stars. Compared to the vector $ω$ meson-hyperon coupling, the introduction of linear correlations in hypernuclear physics imposes a more substantial constraint on the scalar $σ$ meson-hyperon coupling, significantly enhancing its coupling strength and thereby ensuring the stiffness of the equation of state, highlighting the crucial role of hypernuclear studies in solving the hyperon puzzle problem. Consequently, a maximum mass of around $2M_{\odot}$ can be achieved with all five interactions considered in this study under the combined constraints from astronomical observations and nuclear physics. With more reliably estimated hyperon-nucleon contributions, the uncertainties in both the fractions and the threshold densities at which hyperons appear inside neutron stars are notably reduced, along with those in the mass-radius predictions.",Shi Yuan Ding,2025/6/20,2025/10/16,,N/A,"['nucl-th', 'astro-ph.HE']"

Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms.

Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution.

A crucial part of this puzzle is how the carrier density predicted by electronic structure calculations is recovered for $p > p^*$. Here, we use magnetic fields up to 67 T to suppress superconductivity down to 50 K, allowing simultaneous measurement of the low-temperature Hall number $n_{\mathrm{H}}$ and the in-plane resistivity anisotropy $ρ_a/ρ_b$ in overdoped Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ single crystals. We confirm a previous finding [Badoux et al., Nature 531, 210 (2016)] that $n_{\mathrm{H}}$(50 K) exhibits a sharp increase below $p^*$. Using the measured resistivity anisotropy, we extract the planar carrier density $n_{\mathrm{pl}} = n_{\mathrm{H}} (ρ_a/ρ_b)^{-1}$. The doping dependence of $n_{\mathrm{pl}}$(50 K) reveals two key findings: (i) at optimal doping, $n_{\mathrm{pl}} \approx p$, and (ii) the sharp rise in $n_{\mathrm{H}}(p)$ is softened such that the full Fermi volume ($n_{\mathrm{pl}} = 1 + p$) is only partially recovered at $p^*$.

Our experiments establish that models cannot consistently solve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems are explicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\times$, etc., as in ""twenty + three""). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters of numeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use their linguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicit compositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicit numeral structure.

Recently, ferroelectricity has been demonstrated in semiconducting halide perovskites, offering both a rare combination of ferroelectricity and semiconductivity in the same material and a possible alternative to the prevailing perovskite oxide ferroelectrics. We propose a route to simulating such materials at finite temperatures capable of reproducing key experimental and first-principle data, such as Curie temperature, phase transition sequence, spontaneous polarization, and soft mode frequencies. The key methodological finding is the superior performance of hybrid exchange correlation functionals in parametrization of effective Hamiltonians for ferroelectrics with lone pair. The parametrization for effective Hamiltonians for CsGeX$_3$, (X=Cl, Br, I) is reported. The application of methodology to study polarization reversal in CsGeX$_3$, allows for the development of a ``minimalistic"" model for polarization reversal in ferroelectrics that provides an insight into the mechanisms of polarization reversal and its key features, such as the relationship between the coercive field, temperature, and AC field frequency. Importantly, the model reveals the origin of the well-known and ever-puzzling overestimation of coercive fields in computations. Furthermore, we report a variety of finite-temperature properties of CsGeX$_3$, ferroelectrics, such as dielectric susceptibility, pyroelectric coefficients, and energy storage density, which reveal that these halide perovskites possess properties comparable to their oxide counterparts.

However, models predict that the bursts should cease at high accretion rates, whereas in many sources they disappear at much lower rates. Moreover, their recurrence times also show strong discrepancies with predictions. Although various solutions have been proposed, none can account for all the observational constraints. Here we describe a new model that explains all the contradictory behaviours within a single picture. We are able to reconstruct the conditions on the star surface that determine the burst properties by comparing data to new simulations.

Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887v3,"Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning, but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information. However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.",Yixiao Huang,2025/6/12,2025/10/25,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"

The experimental conditions are simulated by a combination of classical dynamics calculations of the deposition events, systematic searches of saddle points representing transition states for thermally activated events and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of long timescale evolution of the system over a temperature range from 100 K to 300 K. While the calculated energy barriers for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the Si dimer rows are found to be nearly equal, indicating isotropic diffusion, the simulations show highly anisotropic diffusion, as the optimal migration mechanism involves multiple hops of Ag adatoms on top of Si dimer rows. Impinging Ag atoms are found to have a 90% chance of landing on top of a dimer row and while the hot spot created cools down too fast for transient mobility to play an important role, the energy barrier for thermally activated hops along the dimer row is low enough for migration to be active even at 100 K. A migrating Ag adatom can dimerise with another Ag adatom sitting at a stable binding site in between rows or another adatom on top of the same row. The simulations for deposition at 140 K show that most of the deposited Ag atoms end up forming dimers.",Alejandro Peña-Torres,2025/6/9,2025/6/9,,N/A,['cond-mat.mtrl-sci']
2506.08116v2,The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116v2,"James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for ""astrophysical"" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological"" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.",Pratika Dayal,2025/6/9,2025/11/21,,N/A,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.CO']"

Although Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that certain forms of sentences like ""Some Italians come from a warm country,"" when conjoined as in ""(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"" sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the conjunctive predicate: in examples such as ""(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"" this interpretation generates an indirect contextual contradiction.

The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.",X. R.

While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.",Parshin Shojaee,2025/6/7,2025/11/20,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery, exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy, with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning, are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning.

The new data are used to study line-strengths of K-band absorption features from different chemical species, namely Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, and CO, as a function of galactocentric distance, out to 40arcsec from the center (about half of the galaxy effective radius). The radial trends of spectral indices are compared to those for the bulge of M31, observed with the same instrument. For M87, most K-band indices exhibit flat radial profiles, with the exception of NaI2.21, that decreases outwards, with a negative radial gradient. Significant offsets are found between indices for M87 and those for the bulge of M31, the latter having weaker line-strengths for almost all features, but Fe and Ca, for which we find similar trends in both systems. We find that the behavior of CO features - most prominent in giant stars - is difficult to explain, consistent with previous results for the central regions of massive galaxies. In particular, the CO indices are stronger in M87 than M31, and do not exhibit significant radial gradients in M87, despite its IMF being bottom heavier than M31 especially in its central region. Predictions of state-of-the-art stellar population models, based on results from the optical spectral range, are able to match only the Na and Ca indices of M87, while a significant mismatch is found for all other indices. This shows that state-of-the-art stellar population models should be improved significantly in order to provide reliable constraints on the stellar population content of galaxies in the NIR spectral range.",F.

Using a reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks, especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning. Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on task-specific symbolic tools.",Zhen Hao Wong,2025/6/5,2025/6/5,,N/A,['cs.LG']

We reveal a striking pump laser wavelength dependence - the 800 nm light fails to suppress CO, whereas the 400 nm light effectively melts it. This behavior originates from the fact that 400 nm photons can promote electrons from the Zhang-Rice singlet band to the upper Hubbard band or apical oxygen states, while 800 nm photons lack the energy to excite electrons across the charge-transfer gap. The CO recovery time ($\sim$3 ps) matches that of the underdoped cuprates, indicating universal electronic instability in the phase diagram.

Applied to NLSY97 data on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), our model reveals substantial household-level heterogeneity in both attention and choice probabilities. Furthermore, counterfactual simulations predict that choice-nudging policies outperform attention-boosting policies.

For the hard state, we examine compact and extended corona models. We find that compact corona models are energetically favored, but extended models cannot be fully excluded. We discuss the high linear polarization of the Cyg X-1 X-rays in the soft and hard states, parallel to the direction of the radio jet. We propose the presence of a pair layer enveloping the accretion disk moving at approximately half the speed of light away from the disk for both the soft and the hard state. In the soft state, the pairs cool to the Compton temperature of the disk emission. In the hard state, the pairs acquire thermal and bulk motion allowing them to Comptonize the emission to produce the observed power law emission. In both emission states, the bulk motion away from the disk leads to a net polarization parallel to the radio jet.

Existing methods rely on mixtures of parametric families or neural networks with expensive variational inference procedures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages alternative representations for permutations, including Lehmer codes, Fisher-Yates draws, and Insertion-Vectors. These representations form a bijection with the symmetric group, allowing for unconstrained learning using conventional deep learning techniques, and can represent any probability distribution over permutations. Our approach enables a trade-off between expressivity of the model family and computational requirements. In the least expressive and most computationally efficient case, our method subsumes previous families of well established probabilistic models over permutations, including Mallow's and the Repeated Insertion Model. Experiments indicate our method significantly outperforms current approaches on the jigsaw puzzle benchmark, a common task for permutation learning. However, we argue this benchmark is limited in its ability to assess learning probability distributions, as the target is a delta distribution (i.e., a single correct solution exists). We therefore propose two additional benchmarks: learning cyclic permutations and re-ranking movies based on user preference.

Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24273v1,"Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability. However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use, remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc 1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness (content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2) more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural patterns over content correctness.

In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues (""head"" over ""heels"").

This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

In spite of extensive experimental study, puzzles remain, however. For example, both shot-noise and Aharonov-Bohm interference measurements sometimes report a charge that is a multiple of the elementary charge. We report here high-precision microscopic calculations that reveal the surprising result that the FQH anyons often bind together into stable clusters, which we term molecular anyons. This is counterintuitive, given that the elementary anyons carry the same charge and are therefore expected to repel one another. The number of anyons in a cluster, its binding energy and its size depend sensitively on the parent FQH state and the interaction between electrons (which is experimentally tunable, e.g., by varying the quantum well width). Our calculations further suggest that the charge-$1/4$ non-Abelian anyons of the $5/2$ FQH state may also bind to form charge-$1/2$ Abelian clusters. The existence of molecular anyons not only can provide a natural explanation for the observed charges, but also leads to a host of new predictions for future experiments and invites a re-analysis of many past ones.",Mytraya Gattu,2025/5/28,2025/5/28,,N/A,"['cond-mat.str-el', 'cond-mat.mes-hall']"

We propose a novel solution to this conundrum in terms of dark matter (DM) scattering in the Earth's crust. We show that intermediate dark-sector particles that decay into muons are copiously produced when high-energy ($\sim100~\text{PeV}$) DM propagates through a sufficient amount of Earth overburden. The same interactions responsible for DM scattering in Earth also source the boosted DM flux from a high-luminosity blazar. We address the non-observation of similar events at IceCube via two examples of weakly coupled long-lived dark sector scenarios that satisfy all existing constraints. We calculate the corresponding dark sector cross sections, lifetimes and blazar luminosities required to yield one event at KM3NeT, and also predict the number of IceCube events for these parameters that can be tested very soon.

In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $β$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 < β\leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 < M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $β> 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.",H.

Although characterizing the CDW phase is essential for understanding and modeling these exotic phenomena, its nature remains unresolved. In this work, we employ first-principles free-energy calculations, accounting for both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results uncover that the CDW ground state is formed by reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers in a triangular hexagonal pattern, featuring energetically degenerate different stacking orders. This accounts for the various out-of-plane modulations observed experimentally and supports the coexistence of multiple domains. The discovered symmetry-broken ground state is consistent with the absence of any electronic anisotropy in transport experiments. By combining anharmonic phonons with the calculation of electron-phonon matrix elements, we predict a superconducting critical temperature for the CDW phase in agreement with experiments, showing that superconductivity is phonon mediated. These findings not only resolve a long-standing structural puzzle, but also clarify the impact of the CDW in superconductivity, highlighting its fundamental importance in shaping the low-temperature quantum phase diagram of Kagome metals.",Manex Alkorta,2025/5/26,2025/8/21,,N/A,['cond-mat.mtrl-sci']

We next investigate the cosmic web environments in which the galaxies are located, using the Hessian matrix of the density field.

Quantum systems access all six dimensions, whereas classical systems such as detectors experience only four dimensions. Therefore, correlated quantum events that are time-like separated in 6D can appear to be space-like separated and, hence, nonlocal, when projected to 4D. Our lack of awareness of the extra time-like dimensions creates the illusion of nonlocality, whereas, in reality, the communication obeys special relativity and is local.

It is well-known that invariant synthesis for RMC subsumes various important verification problems, including safety verification for parameterized systems. To achieve a simple and standardized file format, we treat the invariant synthesis problem as a problem of solving Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) over strings. Two strategies for synthesizing invariants in terms of regular constraints are supported: (1) L* automata learning, and (2) SAT-based automata learning. HornStr implements these strategies with the help of existing SMT solvers for strings, which are interfaced through SMT-LIB. HornStr provides an easy-to-use interface for string solver developers to apply their techniques to verification. At the same time, it allows verification researchers to painlessly tap into the wealth of modern string solving techniques. To assess the effectiveness of HornStr, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation using benchmarks derived from applications including parameterized verification and string rewriting tasks. Our experiments highlight HornStr's capacity to effectively handle these benchmarks, e.g., as the first solver to verify the challenging MU puzzle automatically. Finally, HornStr can be used to automatically generate a new class of interesting SMT-LIB 2.6 string constraint benchmarks, which might in the future be used in the SMT-COMP strings track. In particular, our experiments on the above invariant synthesis benchmarks produce more than 30000 new QF_S constraints.

We develop an abstract formalism encapsulating recent proposals that modify the gravitational path integral in the presence of observers and allow larger Hilbert spaces to be associated with closed universes. Our formalism regards the gravitational path integral as a map from abstract objects called sources to complex numbers, and introduces additional objects called partial sources, which form sources when glued together. We apply this formalism to treat, on equal footing, universes with spatial boundaries, closed universes with prescribed observer worldlines, and closed universes containing observers entangled with external systems. In these contexts, the relevant gravitational Hilbert spaces contain states prepared by partial sources and can consequently have nontrivial $α$-sectors supporting noncommuting operators. Within our general framework, the positivity of the gravitational inner product implies a bound on the Hilbert space trace of certain positive operators over each $α$-sector. The trace of such operators, in turn, quantifies the effective size of this Hilbert space.",Hong Zhe Chen,2025/5/21,2025/7/22,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc']"

Here, we propose a mechanism, within classical electrodynamics, that could fill the voids with late-Universe fields and, under certain conditions, dispel the need for primordial fields altogether to explain the void fields. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields to generate space-filling magnetic fields in voids with white-noise spectrum and sufficient amplitude to explain the lack of GeV halos around TeV blazars observed by Fermi-LAT. A definitive test for such fields in the voids will be the white-noise spectral shape, which will constrain possible plasma processes in the voids to the ones that allow for the propagation of these dipole fields into the voids.",Deepen Garg,2025/5/20,2025/10/8,,N/A,"['astro-ph.CO', 'astro-ph.HE', 'gr-qc', 'hep-th']"

Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a puzzle using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-based and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%.

More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning performance.

This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we ""warm up"" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro; $(ii)$ When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$ Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training.

In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs' performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training.

However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection. The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability.

This quantum-inspired interpretation not only clarifies why the intuitive misunderstanding arises but also provides generalized formulas consistent with standard Bayesian results.

Their enormous mass is not explainable via sub-Eddington accretion and the frequent presence of relativistic jets at high-z, commonly linked with spinning black holes, suggest a less effective accretion process. NVSS J151002+570243 is part of this population, being the most distant blazar consistently detected by Fermi/LAT, hence hosting a powerful jet. We tested the hypothesis of a super-Eddington accretion process for this source by modeling its big blue bump with a set of accretion disk emission models. We first tested a standard geometrically thin, optically thick $α$-disk, obtaining a mass of Log$M/M_\odot=8.65\pm0.19$ consistent with virial-based results and a significantly sub-Eddington accretion rate $λ=0.02\pm0.01$. We then focused on the analytic approximations of two numerical models that take into account the General Relativity effects of a spinning black hole (reasonable due to the presence of a jet) and a close-to- or super-Eddington accretion rate (KERBB and SLIMBH). Despite the focus on super-critical accretion, these models confirm a surprisingly low Eddington ratio, of the order of 3\%. The hypothesis of a continuous accretion at this measured rate is unrealistic, since it would imply a seed black hole mass of $\sim10^6-10^8M_\odot$ at redshift z=20. Hence we explore the possibility of a continuous super-critical accretion starting from a $\sim10^2M_\odot$ seed, that would spin up the black hole and eventually contribute in launching the relativistic jet. The measured low accretion rate would thus happen only once the jet is active. This idea would reconcile the black holes with large masses accreting at somewhat slow rates that are observed at z>4, with the need of an extremely fast evolution, by allowing the formation of stellar-size black hole seeds even as late as at $z\sim8$.",Gabriele Alzati,2025/5/16,2025/5/16,,N/A,['astro-ph.HE']

Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. Although high obscuration is the most straightforward way to explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, JWST rest-frame optical/UV spectra initially argued against the presence of Compton-thick gas clouds. Instead, several authors have proposed that LRDs are intrinsically X-ray weak due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we observationally test these tailored models by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N_{\rm H}\gtrsim10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$).

Human accuracy dropped significantly when rereading was restricted (73%), falling below that of Falcon-180B-Chat (76%) and GPT-4 (81%). The newer GPT-o1 model achieves perfect accuracy. Results further show that both humans and models are disproportionately challenged by queries involving potentially reciprocal actions (e.g., kissing), suggesting shared pragmatic sensitivities rather than model-specific deficits. Additional analyses using Llama-2-70B log probabilities, a recoding of open-ended model responses, and grammaticality ratings of other sentences reveal systematic underestimation of model performance.

The shocks radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio synchrotron to GeV gamma-rays. The hot shocked gas also emits >~ keV thermal X-rays, typically peaking weeks after the eruption, once the ejecta becomes transparent to photoelectric absorption. However, the observed hard X-ray luminosities are typically >4 orders of magnitude smaller than would be naively expected given the powerful shocks implied by the gamma-rays. We argue that a key missing piece to this puzzle is turbulence behind the shock, driven, e.g., by thin-shell and/or thermal instabilities. Turbulence efficiently mixes the hot X-ray emitting gas with cooler gas, sapping the hot gas of energy faster than it can directly radiate. Using analytic arguments motivated by numerical simulations, we show that energy losses due to turbulent mixing can easily balance shock heating, greatly reducing the volume of the hot gas and suppressing the X-ray luminosity. Equating the characteristic thickness of the X-ray emitting region to the minimum outer length scale of the turbulence capable of cooling the hot gas through mixing, we obtain X-ray luminosities consistent with nova observations if only ~1% of the shock's kinetic power goes into turbulent motions. A similar process may act to suppress thermal X-rays from other shock powered transients, such as interacting supernovae.",Brian D. Metzger,2025/5/13,2025/6/10,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.SR']"

2505.07820v1,Revisiting the Excess Volatility Puzzle Through the Lens of the Chiarella Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07820v1,"We amend and extend the Chiarella model of financial markets to deal with arbitrary long-term value drifts in a consistent way. This allows us to improve upon existing calibration schemes, opening the possibility of calibrating individual monthly time series instead of classes of time series. The technique is employed on spot prices of four asset classes from ca. 1800 onward (stock indices, bonds, commodities, currencies). The so-called fundamental value is a direct output of the calibration, which allows us to (a) quantify the amount of excess volatility in these markets, which we find to be large (e.g. a factor $\approx$ 4 for stock indices) and consistent with previous estimates; and (b) determine the distribution of mispricings (i.e. the difference between market price and value), which we find in many cases to be bimodal. Both findings are strongly at odds with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. We also study in detail the 'sloppiness' of the calibration, that is, the directions in parameter space that are weakly constrained by data. The main conclusions of our study are remarkably consistent across different asset classes, and reinforce the hypothesis that the medium-term fate of financial markets is determined by a tug-of-war between trend followers and fundamentalists.",Jutta G.

2505.07764v1,Why is the Star Formation Rate Proportional to Dense Gas Mass?,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07764v1,"One of the most profound empirical laws of star formation is the Gao-Solomon relation, a linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense molecular gas mass. It is puzzling how the complicated physics in star-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using archival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Observations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and high-mass star-forming regions. We discovered a significant correlation $\log(M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}/M_{\odot}) = 0.506 \log(M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}/M_{\odot})-0.32$. Our discovered $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$-$M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon relation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ are tightly related through $\log({\rm SFR}/(M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \log(m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})-5.80$. Intriguingly, both requirements have been suggested by previous theoretical studies (c.f. Yan et al. 2017). Based on this result, we hypothesize that the Gao-Solomon relation is a consequence of combining the following three non-trivial relations (i) SFR vs. $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$, (ii) $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ vs. $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$, and (iii) $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ vs. $M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$.

With machine learning we further show reliable predictive power to differentiate between workload levels in the N-Back task, and also achieve effective cross-task classification.

This ``Geometric Vacuum Energy'' (GVE) is shown to be consistent across both cosmological and astrophysical scales. We demonstrate that a natural attractor solution alleviates the Hubble tension, yielding an inferred $H_0 \approx 69.4\ \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and a suppressed structure growth parameter $S_8 \approx 0.67$, while remaining in excellent agreement with cosmic chronometer data ($χ^2/N \approx 0.44$). Its predictions in the strong-gravity regime profoundly strengthen the framework's self-consistency. We show that this model supports stable, hairy black hole solutions whose existence conditions are congruent with the cosmological attractor ($Φ_{\text{horizon}} \leftrightarrow Φ_{\text{cosmology}}$). Furthermore, these objects exhibit a rich, falsifiable phenomenology, including (i) the definitive breaking of isospectrality in their gravitational-wave quasi-normal modes, (ii) a suppressed Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, and (iii) unique thermodynamic and electromagnetic accretion signatures.

The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, as it varies with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of each component over solar cycles.  In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near Earth.  We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with the sunspot number and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, as expected, confirming its emission mechanism. In contrast, the extended component exhibits a more complex variation: despite an initial anticorrelation with the sunspot number, we find neither anticorrelation with the sunspot number nor correlation with cosmic-ray electrons over the full 15-year period. This most likely suggests that cosmic-ray transport and modulation in the inner heliosphere are unexpectedly complex and may differ for electrons and protons or, alternatively, that there is an additional, unknown component of gamma rays or cosmic rays.

Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

Notably, we detect significantly elevated $\rm [O\,I]$/$\rm H α$ ratios, which can be well reproduced by photoionization models incorporating both $\rm H II$ regions and low-velocity shocks ($v$ $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$). We caution that neglecting shock excitation can bias abundance measurements, leading to an overestimation of nitrogen enrichment. This provides a potential explanation for the long-standing puzzle of enhanced $\rm [N\,II]$/$\rm H α$ ratios observed in $z\sim2$ galaxies.

Motivated by the discrepancies in the $v_2$-to-$v_3$ puzzle found in Pb--Pb collisions and the low-energy nuclear structure calculations of nuclear deformation, we studied the first basic observables necessary for any study in heavy-ion collisions. Using the HYDJET++ framework, we calculate the pseudorapidity distribution, transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra, and average anisotropic flow ($v_2$ and $v_3$) of primary charged hadrons with different parameters in two geometrical configurations: body-body and tip-tip types of Pb--Pb collisions. The kinematic ranges $0 < p_{\mathrm{T}} < 20~\mathrm{GeV}/c$ and $|η| < 0.8$ are considered. We observe that the charged hadron multiplicity and transverse momentum spectra are dependent on the strength of the octupole deformation parameter.

Another big puzzle is about the arrow of time: why is there only one direction of time? Are these two issues related? One way to solve both puzzles at one stroke is to posit that our universe was pair-created with a twin, whose time arrow is opposite to ours. If so, then the twins must naturally be quantum entangled. In Euclidean quantum gravity, this implies the existence of a Euclidean wormhole bridging the twin universes. Each universe is then in a mixed-state and the mutual entanglement shall leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum. Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks wormhole as a toy model for the sake of tractability, we show that the entanglement selects a novel and unique global vacuum for the total inflaton perturbations in both universes. This is equivalent to imposing a simple harmonic oscillator boundary condition on the Euclidean wavefunction of the total perturbations, and it turns out that the entanglement enhances the CMB power spectrum for long-wavelength modes.

In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle. Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes.

However, these derivations ignore two effects that are central to quantum field theoretic calculations of the electron's magnetic moment: self-interaction and mass renormalization. Those two effects can and should be incorporated when analyzing the Dirac equation, to better isolate the distinctive improvements of quantum field theory. Either of the two aforementioned derivations can be modified accordingly. Doing so yields a magnetic moment that depends on the electron's state (even among $z$-spin up states).

Determining their age distribution and temporal evolution is vital for uncovering their formation and evolutionary pathways. Using a sample of over 1,000 short-period planets around Sun-like stars, we find that the host stars of USP planets are relatively older and have a higher prevalence in the Galactic thick disk compared to stars hosting other short-period planets. Furthermore, we find that the occurrence of USP planets increases with stellar age and uncover evidence indicating that USP planetary system architectures evolve on Gyr timescales. This includes a distinct dip-pileup in period distributions around ~1 day and an expansion of orbital spacings with time. In addition, younger USP planet systems are observed to have fewer multiple transiting planets, implying fewer nearby companions and/or larger mutual orbital inclinations. Our findings suggest that USP planets continuously form through inward migration driven by tidal dissipation over Gyr timescales, and that younger and older USP planets may have originated via different specific tidal migration pathways.",Pei-Wei Tu,2025/4/29,2025/4/29,,N/A,['astro-ph.EP']

However, offloading user tasks to heterogeneous and decentralized edge devices comes with the dual risk of both endangered user data security and privacy due to the curious base station or malicious edge servers, and unfair offloading and malicious attacks targeting edge servers from other edge servers and/or users. Existing solutions to edge access control and offloading either rely on ""always-on"" cloud servers with reduced edge benefits or fail to protect sensitive user service information. To address these challenges, this paper presents SA2FE, a novel framework for edge access control, offloading and accounting. We design a rerandomizable puzzle primitive and a corresponding scheme to protect sensitive service information from eavesdroppers and ensure fair offloading decisions, while a blind token-based scheme safeguards user privacy, prevents double spending, and ensures usage accountability. The security of SA2FE is proved under the Universal Composability framework, and its performance and scalability are demonstrated with implementation on commodity mobile devices and edge servers.",Xiaojian Wang,2025/4/28,2025/4/28,,N/A,['cs.CR']

A long-standing puzzle of too large a ratio of the elliptical-to-triangular ($v_{2}$-to-$v_{3}$) anisotropies in ultracentral $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) cannot be solved simply by hydrodynamic simulations with initial conditions containing the spherical or certain deformed shape of $^{208}$Pb. In this Letter, using the iEBE-VISHNU relativistic viscous hydrodynamic hybrid model simulations with the Trento initial condition, we show that a dynamic octupole deformation--a shape-breathing of $^{208}$Pb --could potentially solve the $v_{2}$-to-$v_{3}$ puzzle and simultaneously describe the $v_3\{4\}$ data measured in experiment.

This discrepancy stems from shear viscosity suppressing higher-order geometric eccentricities, resulting in underestimated $v_3$ when using the conventional QGP viscosity coefficient. We explore two initial-state modifications to resolve this puzzle: (1) enforcing a minimum nucleon separation distance to homogenize distributions, and (2) amplifying sub-nucleon structures to reduce initial eccentricity. Using TRENTo initial conditions and 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic model CLVisc, both approaches significantly lower geometric eccentricity, reduce required viscosity, and narrow the $v_2$-$v_3$ gap in ultra-central collisions. Our results implicate initial-state nuclear and sub-nucleon structures as critical factors in addressing this puzzle. Resolving it would advance nuclear structure studies and improve precision in extracting QGP transport coefficients (e.g., shear viscosity), bridging microscopic nuclear features to macroscopic quark-gluon plasma properties.",Qi Wang,2025/4/27,2025/4/27,,N/A,"['nucl-th', 'hep-ph']"

To interpret such data, we update the public simulation code, 21cmFASTv4, to include a discrete source model based on stochastic sampling of conditional mass functions and semi-empirical galaxy relations. We demonstrate that our new galaxy model, which parametrizes the means and scatters of well-established scaling relations, is flexible enough to characterize very different predictions from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxies. Combining a discrete galaxy population with approximate, efficient radiative transfer allows us to self-consistently forward-model galaxy surveys, line intensity maps (LIMs), and observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Not only does each observable probe different scales and physical processes, but cross-correlation will maximise the information gained from each measurement by probing the galaxy-IGM connection at high-redshift. We find that a stochastic source field produces significant shot-noise in 21cm and LIM power spectra. Scatter in galaxy properties can be constrained using UV luminosity functions and/or 21cm power spectra, especially if astrophysical scatter is higher than expected (as might be needed to explain recent JWST observations).

2504.17024v1,Hunting Star-Forming Galaxies in the Gamma-Ray Domain,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17024v1,"Context. Star-forming galaxies emit γrays with relatively low luminosity, but the study of their emission is no less captivating. While it is known that their γ-ray luminosity in the GeV band is strongly linked to their star formation, the origin of their emission at higher energies remains uncertain due to limited observations. Aims. Our aim is to assemble the largest possible sample of star-forming galaxies with potential detectability by the new-generation of Cherenkov telescopes. Methods. To achieve this, we compile a comprehensive sample of galaxies, including those previously detected by Fermi-LAT in the GeV energy range as well as a larger sample of star-forming galaxies in the Local Volume that have been cataloged in the near-infrared band. We estimate their γ-ray flux assuming a proportional relationship with their star formation rate, and then select the brightest candidates. The predicted spectra in the TeV band are derived using a simple empirical model normalized to the star formation rate and a model based on extrapolating the latest Fermi-LAT data to higher energies. The ground-based detectability of γ-ray emission from these sources is assessed through a comparison to the most recent instrument response functions. Results. Our investigation reveals that almost a dozen star-forming galaxies may be detectable by upcoming γ-ray telescopes. Conclusions. The observation of numerous star-forming galaxies in the TeV band is a fundamental piece of the panchromatic puzzle for understanding the physics inside these galaxies. The significant increase in the number of galaxies that can be studied in detail in the near future, particularly with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, promises a major step forward in the study of the conditions of acceleration and transport of cosmic rays in nearby extragalactic environments.",P.

Competing hypotheses invoke either slow mass-wasting or the relentless trampling of grazing animals, yet no mechanistic model has linked hoof-scale behavior to landscape-scale form. Here we bridge that gap with an active-walker model in which ungulates are represented as stochastic foragers moving on an erodible slope. Each agent weighs the energetic cost of climbing against the benefit of fresh forage; every hoof-fall compacts soil and lowers local biomass, subtly reshaping the energy landscape that guides subsequent steps. Over time, these stigmergic feedbacks concentrate traffic along cross-slope paths that coalesce into periodic tread-and-riser bands, morphologically analogous to natural terracettes. Our model illustrates how local foraging rules governing movement and substrate feedback can self-organize into large-scale topographic patterns, highlighting the wider role of decentralized biological processes in sculpting terrestrial landscapes.",Benjamin Seleb,2025/4/23,2025/4/23,,N/A,['q-bio.QM']

Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter.

These objects have attracted considerable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect tensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS). Deciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult problem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by Leonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of ""36 officers"". It took more than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet another century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36 entangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and verification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. In this paper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose the Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^6)^{\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct sum $(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 2}\oplus(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 3}$ comprising superpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise when certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors. Technically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions ansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and Życzkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a two-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families.

We construct a low-energy (and low complexity) boundary operator whose expectation values in the descriptions with and without the baby universe cannot match if the baby universe is semiclassical. This operator conclusively identifies the actual bulk dual: the spacetime without a semiclassical baby universe. This result assumes only that AdS/CFT admits an extrapolate dictionary and an asymptotically isometric encoding of the causal wedge into the dual CFT, without which the correspondence may well be vacuous.",Netta Engelhardt,2025/4/20,2025/4/20,,N/A,['hep-th']

Here, we examine this hypothesis in light of the recent data on the surface temperature on the early Earth, thereby imposing a few constraints on the admissible values of the local Hubble parameter. As follows from our analysis, the Krizek-Somer mechanism might be a valuable tool to resolve the important geophysical and paleontological puzzles, but the particular value of the local Hubble parameter is substantially affected by the current uncertainties in our knowledge about the temperature and other properties of the early Earth.",Yurii V.

In promoting brightness and enriching the functionalities of the downshifting luminescence of RENPs, numerous studies have exploited inert shell to protect rare-earth dopants from surface quenchers. However, internal concentration quenching remains an unsolved puzzle when using higher dopant concentrations of rare-earth ions in an attempt to obtain brighter emission. Following a plethora of research involving core-shell structures, the interface has shown to be controllable, ranging from a well-defined, abrupt boundary to an obscure one with cation intermixing. By utilizing this inter-mixed core-shell property for the first time, we design a new architecture to create a homogeneous double-layer core-shell interface to extend the active layer, allowing more luminescent centers without severe concentration quenching. By systematically deploying the crystallinity of the starting core, shell growth dynamics, and dopant concentrations, the downshifting luminescence intensity of new archictecture achieves a 12-fold enhancement surpassing the traditional core-shell structure.

Even if such an announcement is prima facie anonymous, depending on the background knowledge of the agents it might reveal the identity of the announcer: if I post something on a message board, the information might reveal who I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore, like in the Russian Cards puzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention was to stay anonymous, that in fact might reveal more information. In this paper we first look at the case when no assumption about intentions are made, in which case the logic with an anonymous public announcement operator is reducible to epistemic logic. We then look at the case when we assume common knowledge of the intention to stay anonymous, which is both more complex and more interesting: in several ways it boils down to the notion of a ``safe"" announcement (again, similarly to Russian Cards).

This flavon may shed light on the long-standing muon $g-2$ puzzle. In this work, we explore this idea in the $({B-L})_{13}$ gauge extension to the standard model (SM), in which realistic neutrino mixing requires both a SM singlet flavon $s$ and a vector-like lepton (VLL) doublet. The dominant coupling between the flavon and leptons is in the manner of lepton-flavor-violation (LFV). Through an analytical analysis of the SM lepton-VLL mixing matrix, we find that the parameter space of the $s\barμe$-type flavon to explain the muon $g-2$ has been completely excluded by the specific LFV process, muonium-antimuonium oscillation. But the $s\barμτ$-type flavon still has the opportunity; however, it confronts the strong constraint from $τ\to μ$ conservation and, in particular, the lepton flavor universality test of $Z$ boson decay, which arises due to our way to realize the LFV flavon. The surviving flavon is highly predictable, with mass in the narrow window $m_τ\lesssim m_s\lesssim 1.5~ m_τ$ and LFV coupling strength $\sim 10^{-2}$.

Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission, which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions, particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work.

A key challenge we identify is that naive fine-tuning can degrade the model's search capability; we show this can be mitigated with a smaller learning rate.

2504.10907v1,Evidence for GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Intense GRB 240529A During the Afterglow's Shallow Decay Phase,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10907v1,"X-ray light curves of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows exhibit various features, with the shallow decay phase being particularly puzzling. While some studies report absence of the X-ray shallow decay for hyper-energetic GRBs, recently discovered GRB 240529A shows a clear shallow decay phase with an isotropic gamma-ray energy of \SI{2.2e54}{erg}, making it a highly unusual case compared to typical GRBs. In order to investigate the physical mechanism of the shallow decay, we perform the \textit{Fermi}-LAT analysis of GRB 240529A along with \textit{Swift}-XRT analysis. We find no jet break feature in the X-ray light curve and then give the lower bound of the collimation-corrected jet energy of $>10^{52}$~erg, which is close to the maximum rotational energy of a magnetar. Our LAT data analysis reveals evidence of GeV emission with a statistical significance of $4.5σ$ during the shallow decay phase, which can be interpreted as the first case for hyper-energetic GRBs with a typical shallow decay phase. The GeV to keV flux ratio is calculated to be $4.2\pm2.3$. Together with X-ray spectral index, this indicates an inverse Compton origin of the GeV emission. Multiwavelength modeling based on time-dependent simulations tested two promising models, the energy injection and wind models. Both models can explain the X-ray and gamma-ray data, while our modeling demonstrates that gamma-ray observations, along with future GeV--TeV observations by CTAO, will distinguish between them.",Kenta Terauchi,2025/4/15,2025/4/15,,N/A,['astro-ph.HE']
2504.10885v1,PuzzleBench: A Fully Dynamic Evaluation Framework for Large Multimodal Models on Puzzle Solving,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10885v1,"Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks, achieving ever-increasing performance on various evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks are typically static and often overlap with pre-training datasets, leading to fixed complexity constraints and substantial data contamination issues. Meanwhile, manually annotated datasets are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subject to human bias and inconsistency, leading to reliability and reproducibility issues. To address these problems, we propose a fully dynamic multimodal evaluation framework, named Open-ended Visual Puzzle Generation (OVPG), which aims to generate fresh, diverse, and verifiable evaluation data automatically in puzzle-solving tasks. Specifically, the OVPG pipeline consists of a raw material sampling module, a visual content generation module, and a puzzle rule design module, which ensures that each evaluation instance is primitive, highly randomized, and uniquely solvable, enabling continual adaptation to the evolving capabilities of LMMs. Built upon OVPG, we construct PuzzleBench, a dynamic and scalable benchmark comprising 11,840 VQA samples. It features six carefully designed puzzle tasks targeting three core LMM competencies, visual recognition, logical reasoning, and context understanding. PuzzleBench differs from static benchmarks that quickly become outdated. It enables ongoing dataset refreshing through OVPG and a rich set of open-ended puzzle designs, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving capabilities of LMMs.",Zeyu Zhang,2025/4/15,2025/4/15,,N/A,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']"

While most existing models focus on solving either small-scale puzzles or puzzles with no gap between fragments, solving large-scale puzzles with gaps presents distinctive challenges in both image understanding and combinatorial optimization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework of Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Multi-head Puzzle Perception (ERL-MPP) to derive a better set of swapping actions for solving the puzzles. Specifically, to tackle the challenges of perceiving the puzzle with gaps, a Multi-head Puzzle Perception Network (MPPN) with a shared encoder is designed, where multiple puzzlet heads comprehensively perceive the local assembly status, and a discriminator head provides a global assessment of the puzzle. To explore the large swapping action space efficiently, an Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (EvoRL) agent is designed, where an actor recommends a set of suitable swapping actions from a large action space based on the perceived puzzle status, a critic updates the actor using the estimated rewards and the puzzle status, and an evaluator coupled with evolutionary strategies evolves the actions aligning with the historical assembly experience. The proposed ERL-MPP is comprehensively evaluated on the JPLEG-5 dataset with large gaps and the MIT dataset with large-scale puzzles. It significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models on both datasets.",Xingke Song,2025/4/13,2025/4/13,,N/A,['cs.CV']

The field generally fragments into Q-balls, whose rapid decay induces enhanced gravitational waves. In this Letter, we investigate the anisotropies in this gravitational wave background as a new essential observable for AD baryogenesis. The evolution of AD field causes non-Gaussian baryonic isocurvature perturbations, and the non-Gaussianity modulates the spatial distribution of Q-balls on large scales, resulting in large-scale anisotropies in the Q-ball-induced gravitational wave background. We present that the anisotropies can be significantly large with a reduced angular power spectrum $\sim 10^{-2}$, and can be detected by future experiments like LISA. Moreover, these anisotropies universally reveal the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field, opening a novel road to explore the longstanding baryon asymmetry puzzle.",Yan-Heng Yu,2025/4/10,2025/4/10,,N/A,"['astro-ph.CO', 'gr-qc', 'hep-ph']"

The halo mass function in dynamical dark energy cosmologies,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07608v1,"The halo mass function (HMF) is fundamental for interpreting the number counts of galaxy clusters, serving as a pivotal theoretical tool in cosmology. With the advent of high-precision surveys such as LSST, eROSITA, DESI, and Euclid, accurate HMF modeling becomes indispensable to avoid systematic biases in cosmological parameter estimation from cluster cosmology. Moreover, these surveys aim to shed light on the dark sector and uncover dark energy's puzzling nature, necessitating models that faithfully capture its features to ensure robust parameter inference. We aim to construct a model for the HMF in dynamical dark energy cosmologies that preserves the accuracy achieved for the standard $Λ(ν)$CDM model of cosmology, while meeting the precision requirements necessary for future cosmological surveys. Our approach models the HMF parameters as functions of the deceleration parameter at the turnaround, a quantity shown to encapsulate essential information regarding the impact of dynamical dark energy on structure formation. We calibrate the model using results from a comprehensive suite of $N$-body simulations spanning various cosmological scenarios, ensuring sub-percent systematic accuracy. We present an HMF model tailored for dynamical dark energy cosmologies. The model is calibrated following a Bayesian approach, and its uncertainty is characterized by a single parameter controlling its systematic error, which remains at the sub-percent level. This ensures that theoretical uncertainties from our model are subdominant relative to other error sources in future cluster number counts analyses.",Tiago Castro,2025/4/10,2025/4/10,,N/A,['astro-ph.CO']

We argue that angular momentum transport by turbulent processes induced by differential rotation is insufficient, and propose that a key role is played by ``magnetic webs."" We define magnetic webs as stable magnetic configurations that enforce corotation of their coupled mass shells, and discuss their resistance to differential torques that occur in stars. Magnetic webs are naturally expected in parts of radiative zones that were formerly convective, retaining memory of extinguished dynamos. For instance, red giants with moderate masses $M\gtrsim 1.3M_\odot$ likely contain a magnetic web deposited on the main sequence during the retreat of the central convective zone. The web couples the helium core to the hydrogen envelope of the evolving red giant and thus reduces spin-up of the contracting core. The magnetic field and the resulting slower rotation of the core are both consistent with asteroseismic observations, as we illustrate with a stellar evolution model with mass $1.6M_\odot$. Evolved massive stars host more complicated patterns of convective zones that may leave behind many webs, transporting angular momentum towards the surface. Efficient web formation likely results in most massive stars dying with magnetized and slowly rotating cores.",Valentin A. Skoutnev,2025/4/9,2025/9/25,,N/A,['astro-ph.SR']

This is the youngest transiting planet yet to be detected but its misalignment to the disc is difficult to explain. In this paper we explore the dissolution of an unstable triple system as a potential mechanism to produce this system. We simulate the effects of an ejection interaction in models using a highly inclined, retrograde flyby centred on the primary star of IRAS01425. The escaping star of ~0.35 solar masses inclines both the disc and binary orbits such that they have a relative misalignment of greater than 60 deg, as inferred from observations. The planet orbit also becomes inclined relative to the disc, and our interpretation predicts that the binary should have a highly eccentric orbit (e > 0.5 from our simulations). We additionally demonstrate that despite the high relative misalignment of the disc it is unlikely to be vulnerable to von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations.",Rebecca Nealon,2025/4/9,2025/4/9,,N/A,['astro-ph.EP']

The goal is to be able to derive for each input instance the degree of possibility that it belongs to a target (meta-)concept. This (meta-)concept is connected to intermediate concepts by a possibilistic rule-based system. The probability of each intermediate concept for the input instance is inferred using a neural network. The connection between the low-level perception task and the high-level reasoning task lies in the transformation of neural network outputs modeled by probability distributions (through softmax activation) into possibility distributions. The use of intermediate concepts is valuable for the explanation purpose: using the rule-based system, the classification of an input instance as an element of the (meta-)concept can be justified by the fact that intermediate concepts have been recognized.  From the technical side, our contribution consists of the design of efficient methods for defining the matrix relation and the equation system associated with a possibilistic rule-based system. The corresponding matrix and equation are key data structures used to perform inferences from a possibilistic rule-based system and to learn the values of the rule parameters in such a system according to a training data sample. Furthermore, leveraging recent results on the handling of inconsistent systems of fuzzy relational equations, an approach for learning rule parameters according to multiple training data samples is presented. Experiments carried out on the MNIST addition problems and the MNIST Sudoku puzzles problems highlight the effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic ones.",Ismaïl Baaj,2025/4/9,2025/4/9,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.LO']"

In this paper, starting from 't Hooft's constant field strength ($F$) instantons, the only known exact solutions on $\mathbb T^4$, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools. These solutions are characterized by two positive integers $k, \ell$, $k+\ell=N$, and are self-dual for $\mathbb T^4$ sides $L_μ$ tuned to $k L_1 L_2 = r \ell L_3 L_4$. For gcd$(k,r) = r$, we show, analytically and numerically (for $N = 3$) that the constant-$F$ solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, with $4r$ holonomy moduli. In contrast, when gcd$(k,r) \ne r$, we argue that the self-dual constant-$F$ solutions acquire, in addition to the $4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ holonomies, $4r - 4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ extra moduli, whose turning on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for gcd($k,r) \ne r$, 't Hooft's constant-$F$ solutions are a measure-zero subset of the moduli space on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, a fact explaining a puzzle encountered in arXiv:2307.04795.

While large-scale synthetic datasets have fueled promising learning-based approaches, their generalizability to different domains is limited. Critically, it remains uncertain whether models trained on synthetic datasets can generalize to real-world fractures where breakage patterns are more complex. To bridge this gap, we propose GARF, a generalizable 3D reassembly framework for real-world fractures. GARF leverages fracture-aware pretraining to learn fracture features from individual fragments, with flow matching enabling precise 6-DoF alignments. At inference time, we introduce one-step preassembly, improving robustness to unseen objects and varying numbers of fractures. In collaboration with archaeologists, paleoanthropologists, and ornithologists, we curate Fractura, a diverse dataset for vision and learning communities, featuring real-world fracture types across ceramics, bones, eggshells, and lithics. Comprehensive experiments have shown our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving 82.87\% lower rotation error and 25.15\% higher part accuracy.

A pouring step means pouring water from one vessel with value $a_i$ to another vessel with value $a_j$, where $ 1 \le i \not= j \le k $ and $a_i \le a_j $. After this pouring step the first vessel has value $2a_i$ and the second one value $a_j-a_i$.

2504.01100v2,Repetitions are not all alike: distinct mechanisms sustain repetition in language models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01100v2,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes degrade into repetitive loops, persistently generating identical word sequences. Because repetition is rare in natural human language, its frequent occurrence across diverse tasks and contexts in LLMs remains puzzling. Here we investigate whether behaviorally similar repetition patterns arise from distinct underlying mechanisms and how these mechanisms develop during model training. We contrast two conditions: repetitions elicited by natural text prompts with those induced by in-context learning (ICL) setups that explicitly require copying behavior. Our analyses reveal that ICL-induced repetition relies on a dedicated network of attention heads that progressively specialize over training, whereas naturally occurring repetition emerges early and lacks a defined circuitry. Attention inspection further shows that natural repetition focuses disproportionately on low-information tokens, suggesting a fallback behavior when relevant context cannot be retrieved. These results indicate that superficially similar repetition behaviors originate from qualitatively different internal processes, reflecting distinct modes of failure and adaptation in language models.",Matéo Mahaut,2025/4/1,2025/11/4,,N/A,"['cs.CL', 'cs.LG']"
2504.01059v1,Theory of Linear Magnetoresistance in a Strange Metal,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01059v1,"A central puzzle in strongly correlated electronic phases is strange metallic transport, marked by $T$-linear resistivity and $B$-linear magnetoresistance, in sharp contrast with quadratic scalings observed in conventional metals. Here, we demonstrate that proximity to quantum critical points, a recurring motif in the phase diagrams of strange metal candidates, can explain both transport anomalies. We construct and solve a minimal microscopic model by coupling electronic excitations at the Fermi surface to quantum critical bosons via a spatially disordered Yukawa interaction, as well as static pinned domains of density wave order. The resultant transport relaxation rate scales as $k_B T/\hbar$ at low magnetic fields, and as an effective Bohr magneton $\tildeμ_B B/\hbar$ at low temperatures. Further, the magnetoresistance in our model shows a scaling collapse upon rescaling the magnetic field and the resistance by temperature, in agreement with experimental observations.",Jaewon Kim,2025/4/1,2025/4/1,,N/A,['cond-mat.str-el']

However, their behaviors in superfluid turbulence remain largely unexplored. In this study, we numerically investigate the diffusion and relative dispersion of quantized vortices and superfluid parcels in the 0 K limit in two distinct turbulence regimes: ultra-quantum turbulence, characterized by a randomized vortex tangle, and quasiclassical turbulence, in which locally polarized vortices create large-scale flows resembling classical turbulence. Our results reveal that while vortex segments exhibit similar superdiffusion behavior at short times in both regimes, superfluid parcels behave differently: following the same superdiffusion scaling in ultra-quantum turbulence but deviating significantly in quasiclassical turbulence. This contrast provides a key clue to the origin of short-time superdiffusion, a puzzle since its recent discovery. Additionally, we show that two-body dispersion of both vortex segments and superfluid parcels exhibits distinct scaling behaviors in ultra-quantum and quasiclassical turbulence, highlighting fundamental differences in these two turbulence regimes. Our findings bridge a critical gap in superfluid turbulence research, offering new insights into turbulent transport in inviscid quantum fluids.",Yuan Tang,2025/4/1,2025/4/1,,N/A,"['cond-mat.quant-gas', 'cond-mat.other']"

Mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often tested on high-level problems (such as Olympiad challenges, geometry, word problems, and puzzles), but their low-level number sense remains less explored. We introduce ""Numberland,"" a 100-problem test to evaluate the numerical reasoning abilities of LLM-based agents. The tasks -- basic operations, advanced calculations (e.g., exponentiation, complex numbers), prime number checks, and the 24 game -- aim to test elementary skills and their integration in solving complex and uncertain problems. We evaluated five LLM-based agents: OpenAI's o1 and o1-mini, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Anthropic Claude. They scored 74-95% on the first three tasks that allow deterministic steps to solutions. In the 24 game, which needs trial-and-error search, performance dropped to 10-73%. We tested the top 24 solver (o1 with 73% accuracy) on 25 harder problems, and its score fell to 27%, confirming search as a bottleneck. These results, along with the types of mistakes, suggest a fragile number of LLMs, which is a bit surprising given their prowess in challenging benchmarks.

In this process, we identify two key nodes in knowledge evolution: the critical layers and the mutation layers, dividing the evolution process into three stages: rapid evolution, stabilization, and mutation.

2504.11462v1,Timaeus' Puzzle of the Innumerable Interstices in a Universe Without Void,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11462v1,"Some of the most challenging problems in Timaeus' cosmology arise from the geometry of a universe without any void. On the one hand, the universe is spherical in shape; on the other hand, it must be entirely filled with the four basic particles that make up all bodies in the universe, each shaped like one of four regular polyhedra (cubes, tetrahedra, octahedra and icosahedra). The faces of all these particles are composed of right triangles. However, this leads to two mathematical impossibilities. 1. Obtaining a spherical surface from linear surfaces, as it is impossible to create a circle from straight lines. 2. Obtaining a complete tiling of a sphere using regular polyhedra, without any voids or intersections between these polyhedra. The first problem is addressed in another article slated for publication. In the present one, our focus will be on the second problem, for which we will present a solution within the framework of Timaeus' cosmology. The crux of this solution lies in a feature of Timaeus' universe that sets it apart from almost all ancient cosmologies. Instead of being composed of rigid parts, it is a dynamic living body in which all basic components are in constant motion, continuously undergoing both destruction and reconstruction. In the first part, we examine the main features of Timaeus' cosmology relevant to our issue. In the second part, we analyze the paradox in details and its consequences for Timaeus' cosmology. We then discuss the common 'solutions' and highlight their shortcomings. Finally, we propose a solution that we believe is consistent with Plato's text and independent of the choice of the major schools of interpretation of the Timaeus.",Luc Brisson,2025/3/31,2025/3/31,,N/A,"['math.HO', 'physics.hist-ph']"

In our study, the $Ξ_b\rightarrow Ξ_c$ transition form factors are calculated using several popular models for baryonic light-cone distribution amplitudes. These form factors are then employed to analyze a range of observable quantities for the semileptonic processes via the helicity formalism. Our work presents predictions for the branching fractions of these decays for both the $τ$ and $e$ channels. Notably, the obtained lepton flavor universality ratio, $\mathcal{R}_{Ξ_c}\approx 0.3$, may offer new insights into the $\mathcal{R}^{(*)}$ puzzle. Furthermore, we investigate various angular observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity parameters, and polarization asymmetries, which provide complementary information regarding potential new physics in $b$-baryonic semileptonic transitions. The numerical results for these angular observables are presented as both functions of $q^2$ and as averaged values. We observe that the lepton mass plays a significant role in shaping the angular distributions, affecting most of the observables under consideration. These results are expected to be valuable for both current and future experimental investigations of semileptonic heavy-to-heavy baryon decays.",Zhou Rui,2025/3/31,2025/6/23,,N/A,['hep-ph']

We propose Generative Visual Puzzles (GenVP), a framework to model the entire RPM generation process, a substantially more challenging task. Our model's capability spans from generating multiple solutions for one specific problem prompt to creating complete new puzzles out of the desired set of rules. Experiments on five different datasets indicate that GenVP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance both in puzzle-solving accuracy and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in 22 OOD scenarios. Compared to SOTA generative approaches, which struggle to solve RPMs when the feasible solution space increases, GenVP efficiently generalizes to these challenging setups.

Assessing and enhancing their performance in this domain is crucial, as it reflects their ability to engage in structured reasoning - an essential skill for real-world problem-solving. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus on reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To address these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple difficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking).

We start again from the basic concept that the spring tides of the three pairs of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth and Jupiter excite magneto-Rossby waves at the solar tachocline. While the quadratic action of the sum of these three waves comprises the secondary beat period of 11.07 years, the main focus is now on the action of the even more pronounced period of 1.723 years. Our dynamo model provides oscillations with exactly that period, which is also typical for the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Most remarkable is its agreement with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) events which preferentially occur in the positive phase of an oscillation with a period of 1.724 years. While bimodality of the sunspot distribution is shown to be a general feature of synchronization, it becomes most strongly expressed under the influence of the QBO. This may explain the observation that the solar activity is relatively subdued when compared to that of other sun-like stars. We also discuss anomalies of the solar cycle, and subsequent phase jumps by 180 degrees. In this connection it is noted that the very 11.07-year beat period is rather sensitive to the time-averaging of the quadratic functional of the waves and prone to phase jumps of 90 degrees. On this basis, we propose an alternative explanation of the observed 5.5-year phase jumps in algae-related data from the North Atlantic and Lake Holzmaar that were hitherto attributed to optimal growth conditions.",F.

The recent proposal for anisotropic bond-dependent interactions in such honeycomb cobaltates has raised the prospect of revisiting its Hamiltonian in the context of Kitaev physics. To test this hypothesis, we have combined magnetization, ac-susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements on a BaCo$_{2}$(AsO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ single-crystal, together with advanced modeling. Our experimental results highlight a collinear magnetic ground state with intrinsic disorder associated to an average incommensurate propagation vector. Monte Carlo simulations and linear spin wave calculations were performed to obtain a spin model compatible with this unusual ground state, the dispersion of magnetic excitations and a magnetization plateau under magnetic field. We thus show that bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, including Kitaev-like interactions, are necessary to account for the puzzling properties of this long-explored material, and are hence a general ingredient in the cobaltates.",A.

The expected non-Abelian nature of the FQHSs at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings has particularly sparked considerable recent interest. At sufficiently small fillings, another exotic phase, namely a quantum Wigner crystal (WC) state, dominates. Here we report magneto-transport measurements in an ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D \textit{hole} system where the large hole effective mass leads to a significant LL mixing (LLM) even at very high magnetic fields and affects the many-body states at very small fillings. We observe numerous developing FQHSs at both even- and odd-denominator fillings, deep in the insulating regime at $ν\lesssim$ 1/3 where WC states dominate. The FQHSs we observe at odd-denominator fillings on the flanks of $ν=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are consistent with the Abelian Jain sequence of four-flux and six-flux composite fermions, while the ones at even-denominator fillings $ν=$ 1/4 and 1/6 are likely non-Abelian states emerging from the pairing of these quasiparticles induced by severe LLM. Our results demonstrate that the competition between the FQHSs and WC phases is close at very small fillings even in the presence of severe LLM. We also measure activation energies of WC states near $ν=$ 1/6, and find that they are substantially larger than what has been reported for ultrahigh-quality GaAs 2D electrons. A moderate LLM is believed to lower the activation energy associated to the formation of WC intrinsic defects. The surprisingly large activation energy for our 2DHS with significant LLM is therefore puzzling, and may suggest a different type of intrinsic WC defect compared to that in 2D electrons.",Chengyu Wang,2025/3/26,2025/3/26,,N/A,"['cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cond-mat.str-el']"

The interaction between quarks fully respects the chiral and flavor symmetries. Guided by the success of various low energy theorems, we assume that the explicit breaking of these symmetries occurs only via the current quark masses, and all other symmetry breakings are of dynamical nature. In order to take into account the effects of the finite quark core sizes of the baryons on the equation of state, we make use of an excluded volume framework which respects thermodynamic consistency. The effects generated by the swelling quark cores generally act repulsively and lead to an increase of the pressure with increasing baryon density. On the other hand, in neutron star matter they also lead to a decrease of the density window where hyperons appear, because it becomes energetically more favorable to convert the faster moving nucleons into hyperons. Our quantitative analysis shows that the net effect of the excluded volume is too small to solve the long standing ""hyperon puzzle,"" which is posed by the large observed masses of neutron stars. Thus the puzzle persists in a relativistic effective quark theory which takes into account the short range repulsion between baryons caused by their finite and swelling quark core sizes in a phenomenological way.",Wolfgang Bentz,2025/3/26,2025/3/26,,N/A,"['nucl-th', 'hep-ph']"

We conventionally set $k = 1$ when $G$ is $2$-edge-connected. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $k < N-n$. A \textit{configuration} of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A \textit{move} is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The {\it pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$} is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. Let $\D(G)$ denote the diameter of the graph $G$, and let $\CL(G)$ denote the maximum length of a shortest cycle containing a vertex $v$, taken over all vertices $v$ in all $2$-connected components of $G$. For completeness, we define $\CL(G) := 1$ when $G$ is a tree.

The location of the stream approaches the Galactic center, implying a possible connection between its orbit and its unusual morphology. Here we demonstrate that the morphology of Ophiuchus can be attributed to its interaction with the decelerating Galactic bar, which leads to the flipping or transposition of its tidal tails. The short length of the stream is the result of stars stripped in the ancient past still remaining concentrated, and the spur, as well as the fanning, are composed of either leading or trailing tails built up of stars released at different time intervals. Our new spectroscopic data, obtained as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey $(S^5)$, and modeling of Ophiuchus indicate that, in the presence of the bar, an initial leading tail can be redistributed to the trailing side and vice versa, and the morphology of a stream can be reshaped.

2503.17828v1,Influence of jet depth on the equatorial jet direction on giant planets,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17828v1,"It remains puzzling why, despite their similar nature, Jupiter and Saturn possess a prograde equatorial jet, whereas Uranus and Neptune have a retrograde one. To understand this discrepancy, we use a 2-D quasi-geostrophic model to explore how the penetration depth of the jet, regulated by Ohmic dissipation, influences jet patterns. When jets penetrate deeply into the planet's interior, the Taylor column height decreases equatorward in the equatorial jet region, yielding a negative gradient of planetary potential vorticity (i.e., a negative beta effect). The tendency to eliminate such a gradient leads to a prograde equatorial jet, as observed on Jupiter and Saturn. In contrast, a relatively shallow system favors retrograde jets along the equator due to the positive beta effect of geometry. If the proposed mechanism applies to Uranus and Neptune, the observed jet structure may suggest the presence of a stratified layer or Ohmic dissipation layer near their surfaces.",Yaoxuan Zeng,2025/3/22,2025/3/22,,N/A,['astro-ph.EP']

Here, we report our very long baseline interferometry observation of the brightest GRB 221009A from 5 to 26 days post-burst. Combined with released data, we uncover a remarkable two-stage evolution of the jet lateral size. The jet size initially grew slowly but later expanded rapidly, challenging conventional scenarios. The slow-evolving stage provides a robust lower limit on the jet opening angle and direct evidence of jet propagation in the uniform interstellar medium at this period. The synergy analysis of the whole jet size evolution and multi-wavelength emissions uncovers that GRB 221009A harbors an ultra-narrow jet (with a half-opening angle $\simeq$ 0.01-0.03~radian) that propagates through a wind-like medium before encountering the interstellar medium, which finally undergoes lateral spreading after significant deceleration. These findings provide crucial new insights into relativistic jet dynamics and establish GRB 221009A as a unique case study for understanding the complex physics of GRB outflows.",Jin-Jun Geng,2025/3/22,2025/3/22,,N/A,['astro-ph.HE']

This PN has a complex morphology with multiple shells and contains a pair of structures with a lower degree of ionization compared to the main nebular components. These structures are known as low ionization structures (LISs), and their origin is still a mystery. With the capabilities provided by IFU spectroscopy, we aim to gain a better understanding of the behavior of nebular properties in the LISs. Data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) were used in order to perform a spatially resolved physico-chemical analysis of NGC 3242 both in 2D, through the analysis of emission line maps, and in 1D, simulating long-slit spectroscopy, with pseudo-slits. Through the deeper investigation of MUSE data, we detect new structures perpendicular to the pair of LISs of NGC 3242, which are mainly seen in the light of [S III] and [N II]. In addition, two arc-like structures are revealed. Moreover, an inner jet-like structure is found through its [Fe III] emission. The interaction of the jet with the rim may be related to the formation of knots and blobs. The higher value of Te, is estimated from the [S III] diagnostic lines, followed by Te ([N II]), Te(H I) and finally Te (He I). In all cases, Te is higher at the inner nebular structures. Regarding electron density, ne, is lower at the LISs, while an increase is observed at the nebular rim. Diagnostic diagrams confirm that NGC 3242 is a highly ionized nebula. Moreover, the MUSE data unveiled for the first time in this PN, the atomic line [C I] λ8727, primarily emitted from the LISs.

Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$β$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a ""black hole star"" (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free ""atmosphere"" around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super-Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered ""Little Red Dots"" (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.",Rohan P.

If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$α \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M_\odot,\ r_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$α$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.",Anna de Graaff,2025/3/20,2025/7/14,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']

This hypothesis can be directly tested experimentally without the need for corrections for volume fluctuations. We show that if correlations among protons and antiprotons are driven by global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations only, the equality $\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2 = \hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2$ holds for large systems created in central collisions.

The existence of new fundamental constituents of matter beyond the SM is of great importance for our understanding of Nature. In this context, indirect (non-resonant) indications for new scalar bosons were found in the data from the first run of the LHC, taken between 2010 and 2012 at CERN: an excess in the invariant mass of muon-electron pairs, consistent with a new Higgs boson ($S$) with a mass of $150\pm5$ GeV. Other processes with multiple leptons in the final state, moderate missing energy, and possibly (bottom quark) jets exhibit deviations from the SM predictions. These anomalies can be explained within a simplified model in which a new heavy Higgs boson $H$ decays into two lighter Higgses $S$. This lighter Higgs $S$ subsequently decays to $W$ bosons, bottom quarks and has also an invisible decay mode.  Here, we demonstrate that using this model we can identify narrow excesses in di-photon and $Z$-photon spectra around 152 GeV. By incorporating the latest measurements of di-photons in association with leptons, we obtain a combined global significance of $5.4σ$. This represents the highest significance ever reported for an excess consistent with a narrow resonance beyond the SM (BSM) in high-energy proton-proton collision data at the LHC.

To overcome these limitations, we present \textbf{Atomic Reasoner} (\textbf{AR}), a cognitive inference strategy that enables fine-grained reasoning through systematic atomic-level operations. AR decomposes the reasoning process into atomic cognitive units, employing a cognitive routing mechanism to dynamically construct reasoning representations and orchestrate inference pathways. This systematic methodology implements stepwise, structured cognition, which ensures logical coherence while significantly reducing cognitive load, effectively simulating the cognitive patterns observed in human deep thinking processes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate AR's superior reasoning capabilities without the computational burden of exhaustive solution searches, particularly excelling in linguistic logic puzzles.

2503.15670v4,Noise equals control,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670v4,"Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $π$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $π$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.",Eric De Giuli,2025/3/19,2025/8/29,,N/A,"['q-bio.MN', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'nlin.AO']"

This key observable is linked to the mixing of up and down quarks via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the abundance of primordial elements after the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, the two leading measurement techniques for the neutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred to as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties arising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $τ$SPECT experiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).  UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below $8\,\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and suitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of incidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production, guidance, storage, and detection in $τ$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated simulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN Monte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools: one for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such that the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the experimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing, visualizing, and animating simulation data.  The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with $τ$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for identifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the current experimental setup.",Julian Auler,2025/3/19,2025/8/29,,N/A,"['physics.ins-det', 'nucl-ex']"

Our results show that reasoning effort scales with problem size, but only up to a critical problem complexity. Beyond this threshold, the reasoning effort does not continue to increase, and may even decrease. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the logical coherence of current LLMs as problem complexity increases, and underscores the need for strategies to improve reasoning scalability.

Local dwarfs are often considered proxies for early-Universe galaxies, so this study may provide insights into the role of non-thermal components in the formation and evolution of larger galaxies. By investigating the radio continuum spectra and maps of the starburst dwarf galaxies, we aim to draw conclusions on their magnetic field strengths and configurations, as well as the dynamics of cosmic ray (CR) transport. We perform a radio continuum polarimetry study of two of the brightest starburst IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS) dwarf galaxies, NGC 3125 and IC 4662. By combining data of the Australian Telescope Compact Array (2.1 GHz) and MeerKAT (1.28 GHz), we analyse the underlying emission mechanism and the CR transport in these systems. We find flat spectra in those dwarf galaxies over the entire investigated frequency range, which sharply contrasts with observations of massive spiral galaxies. Because the expected cooling time of CR electrons is much shorter than their escape time, we would expect a steepened steady-state CR electron spectrum. The flat observed spectra suggest a substantial contribution from free-free emission at high frequencies and absorption at low frequencies, which may solve this puzzle. For NGC 3125, we measure a degree of polarisation between 0.75% and 2.6%, implying a turbulent field and supporting the picture of a comparably large thermal emission component that could be sourced by stellar radiation feedback and supernovae.",Sam Taziaux,2025/3/19,2025/3/19,,N/A,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.IM']"

Unlike pixel-manipulation approaches, our method, ShapeShift, explicitly parameterizes each shape within a differentiable vector graphics pipeline, iteratively optimizing placement and orientation through score distillation sampling from pretrained diffusion models. To preserve arrangement clarity, we introduce a content-aware collision resolution mechanism that applies minimal semantically coherent adjustments when overlaps occur, ensuring smooth convergence toward physically valid configurations.

Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity.

By iteratively generating and erasing thoughts, PENCIL can think deeper to solve harder problems using shorter context and less compute. Empirically, we observe PENCIL is significantly more effective and efficient than CoT. For example, we demonstrate PENCIL with a small 25M-parameter transformer and 2048 context length solves Einstein's puzzle -- a task that challenges much larger models like GPT-4.

The rotation law of the conducting fluid is a quasi-Keplerian one. Without rotation all toroidal fields are the more destabilized the more the radial profiles differ from the uniformity. For medium Reynolds numbers of rotation, however, the behaviour of the lines of neutral stability strongly depend on the magnetic Prandtl number. For Pm=1 the differential rotation matches the instability lines of azimuthal fields with and without rings so that the maximally possible Reynolds numbers for fields with smooth radial profiles and such with rings do hardly differ. The magnetic Mach number of the considered examples are of the astrophysically relevant order of magnitude between ten and twenty.  The nonaxisymmetric instability fluctuations form a weak alpha effect of the mean-field electrodynamics which always changes its sign between the walls independent of the Reynolds number, magnetic Prandtl number or the radial profile of the magnetic background field. The resulting dynamo modes work on a similar axial scale as the Tayler instability, hence they are small-scale dynamos. The fields are axially drifting with high phase velocity where at certain periods the azimuthal fields with one-ring geometry develop to fields with two rings along the radius.

Here, we show that low-energy reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with (DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault can be quickly discovered by graph theory as implemented in RG2 code for crystal structure prediction. They exhibit comparable stability to the DAS (DAS-d8-T12) model and similar STM patterns, offering a plausible explanation for the observed Si(111)-7x7 reconstruction. All these reconstructions exhibit metallic behavior in the nonmagnetic (NM) state with isolated narrow bands crossing the Fermi level in varying occupancy. And they are further confirmed as ferromagnetic (FM) metals (DAS-d8-T9H3-B), half-metals (DAS-d8-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3), half-semimetals (DAS-d8-T9H3-A and DAS-d8-T6H6) and even insulators (AB-d10-T12), depending their occupancies of the NM band structures. These findings not only demonstrate the rich electromagnetic phases of reconstructed Si(111) surfaces and their potential for spintronic applications, but also provide a plausible physical explanation for the metal-insulator transition observed on the Si(111) surface.",Yuke Song,2025/3/16,2025/6/18,,N/A,"['cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci']"

We fit stellar population synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, masking out nebular emission lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1-0$ dex for 5 galaxies and upper limits of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-2-0$ dex for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies ($7.4<12+\log{\mathrm{(O/H)}}<8.4$) in the same manner as previous studies of $z\sim2-6$ galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that 2 out of 7 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements relative to O ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}<0$ dex), especially GS-z11-0 ($z=11.12$) with a Fe enhancement ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.68_{-0.55}^{+0.37}$ dex) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at $\sim2σ$. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 ($z=10.60$) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of most galaxies are comparable to those of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) yields, the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the Fe enhancements in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time ($\sim30-50$ Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.",Minami Nakane,2025/3/14,2025/9/7,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']

We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its extension, I-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer reasoning rules and ranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of visual uncertainties on these symbolic analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a two-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction of the correct answer of the puzzles, and 2) we smoothen the distributions of the input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0% -- approaching random chance -- on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty. This drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens. A similar trend is also observed for DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%. On the other hand, a neuro-symbolic probabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves state-of-the-art performances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these out-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest accuracy reduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

We demonstrate that the companions in these compact MSPs binaries are also 511 keV annihilation line emitters using {\tt MEGAlib} simulations (a high energy radiation transport software built with {\tt Geant4}) to compute the particle showers and resulting back splash emission from the pulsar irradiation. The 511 keV signal exhibits strong flux modulation and red/blueshifts associated with a binary orbit, enabling powerful coherent searches. Measuring the 511 keV emission would enable direct $γ\text{-ray}$ characterization of unusual pulsar exoplanets and companions, and allow one to identify the unambiguous presence of active pulsars whose beams do not intercept Earth. Intriguingly, the 511 keV flux is brightest for ultra-compact systems, against which pulsar surveys are systematically biased. These ultra-compact systems are also possibly prime LISA galactic sources. This necessitates future joint LISA-MeV $γ\text{-ray}$ techniques to characterize MSP binaries.

2503.09989v2,Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09989v2,"We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $ω_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $α^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($ω_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.",Liam L.

This paper uses a recently introduced local photon approach to show that the quantised electromagnetic field in a non-inertial reference frame can be modelled without violating the principles of general relativity while both observers share a common vacuum.

II: Deep X-ray observations reveal a Comptonizing inner accretion flow,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08959v1,"Mrk 590 is a Changing Look AGN currently in an unusual repeat X-ray and UV flaring state. Here, we report on deep X-ray observations with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER, obtained at a range of X-ray flux levels. We detect a prominent soft excess below 2 keV; its flux is tightly correlated with that of both the X-ray and UV continuum, and it persists at the lowest flux levels captured. Our Bayesian model comparison strongly favors inverse Comptonization as the origin of this soft excess, instead of blurred reflection. We find only weak reflection features, with R~0.4 assuming Compton-thick reflection. Most of this reprocessing occurs at least $\sim$800 gravitational radii (roughly three light-days) from the continuum source. Relativistically broadened emission is weak or absent, suggesting the lack of a standard `thin disk' at small radii. We confirm that the predicted broad-band emission due to Comptonization is roughly consistent with the observed UV--optical photometry. This implies an optically thick, warm ($kT_e\sim0.3$ keV) scattering region that extends to at least $\sim10^3$ gravitational radii, reprocessing any UV thermal emission. The lack of a standard `thin disk' may also explain the puzzling $\sim3$-day X-ray to UV delay previously measured for Mrk 590. Overall, we find that the X-ray spectral changes in Mrk 590 are minimal, despite substantial luminosity changes. Other well-studied changing look AGN display more dramatic spectral evolution, e.g., disappearing continuum or soft excess. This suggests that a diversity of physical mechanisms in the inner accretion flow may produce a UV--optical changing-look event.",Daniel Lawther,2025/3/11,2025/3/11,,N/A,"['astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.HE']"

Furthermore, we correctly reproduce the entropy for a class of known black holes with purely baryonic magnetic charges.

Recent high-resolution spectroscopic studies of V4641 Sgr have revealed strong ionized emission line features in both the optical and X-ray bands, including P-Cygni signatures, and an unusually low soft state luminosity, indicating that the central engine is obscured. Here we present an analysis of five NuSTAR observations of V4641 Sgr taken during its recent outburst in 2021, when the source was in the soft state. We identify highly ionized Fe K emission lines, consistent with a combination of the near-neutral $6.4$~keV Fe K$α$ line, and the H-like and He-like Fe K$α$ and Fe K$β$ transitions found at $6.7\mbox{--}7$~keV and $\sim8$~keV, and find no evidence for strong relativistic broadening. The line fluxes correlate linearly with the observed disk continuum flux, implying a direct connection between the central engine and the reprocessing region. Most interestingly, all five spectra also show a persistent highly ionized Fe K continuum edge feature at $\sim9$~keV with a stable optical depth, which is likely smeared, implying a localized reprocessing zone.

Although both attempts shed light on the nature of Bohmian particles, neither constitute empirical or theoretical evidence in favour or against pilot wave theory.

It is a ubiquitous fundamental problem of nonequilibrium physics of high importance in material science, biology, and engineering applications such as processing, ink printing, and manufacturing. However, the underlying microscopic mechanisms and degree of universality of the yielding problem remain theoretically poorly understood. We address this problem for dense Brownian suspensions of nanoparticles or colloids that interact via repulsions that induce steric caging and tunable short range attractions that drive physical bond formation. In the absence of deformation, these competing forces can result in fluids, repulsive glasses, attractive glasses, and dense gels of widely varying elastic rigidity and viscosity. Building on a quiescent microscopic theoretical approach that explicitly treats attractive bonding and thermally-induced activated hopping, we formulate a self-consistent theory for the coupled evolution of the transient and steady state mechanical response, and structure as a function of stress, strain, and deformation rate over a wide range of high packing fractions and attraction strengths and ranges. Depending on the latter variables, under step rate shear the theory predicts three qualitatively different transient responses: plastic-like (of two distinct types), static yielding via a single elastic-viscous stress overshoot, and double or 2-step yielding due to an intricate competition between deformation-induced bond breaking and de-caging.

We study the formation of gaseous bars in these galaxies by constructing dynamical models constrained by stellar photometry and HI observations already available. We first analytically study the dynamical stability of the galactic disks against global $m=2$ perturbations. Our results indicate that the stellar and the gas disks are moderately unstable against these bar modes. Using N-body + hydrodynamical simulations employing $RAMSES$, we next find that a purely gaseous bar is formed in an oblate dark matter halo of vertical-to-planar axes ratio $c/a = 0.6 - 0.8$, with a relatively high-spin parameter $Λ= 0.04 - 0.07$, which survives for more than ten dynamical times. Further, the low values of our calculated Mach numbers $M=2-6$ of the gaseous medium comply with the survival of the gaseous bars, unaffected by shock waves. Interestingly, our simulations show the formation of a tiny stellar bar in each case. However, the temporal evolution of the change in angular momentum $L_z$ of the different disk components indicates the exchange of $L_z$ between the gas disk and the dark matter halo only; the $L_z$ of the stellar disk remained unchanged, indicating a weak stellar bar.",Anagha A G,2025/3/5,2025/3/5,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']

We introduce Self-Taught Lookahead (STL), a reward-free framework that improves language model-based value functions by reasoning explicitly about state transitions. STL can be viewed as a chain-of-thought analogue of the value iteration algorithm: instead of regressing directly on numeric values, a value LLM is trained to simulate a step of lookahead in natural language - predicting the next action, resulting state, and rationale for its value, thereby refining value estimates without any labeled data. This self-supervised procedure yields more accurate state-value predictions, which in turn enable lightweight search algorithms to expand fewer states while maintaining strong performance. Empirically, STL-trained value models built on moderately sized (8B parameter) open-weight LLMs boost web agent success rates by 39%, achieving comparable performance with proprietary models. STL also generalizes to multi-hop QA and math puzzles. We find that STL enables small open-source models to guide efficient search, reducing inference costs by integrating explicit reasoning with value learning.",Ethan Mendes,2025/3/4,2025/10/29,,N/A,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']"
2503.02320v2,Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320v2,"In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8πR_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(ρ_{\mathrm{m}}+Π_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $ρ_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $Π_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $ρ_{\mathrm{m}}+Π_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific gravitational theory, offers a universal tool for testing gravitational theories and interpreting astrophysical observations.",Takahisa Igata,2025/3/4,2025/3/31,,N/A,"['gr-qc', 'astro-ph.HE', 'hep-th']"

However, network regulations require disclosing sensitive user information, such as location coordinates and transmission details, raising critical privacy concerns. Moreover, as a database-driven architecture reliant on user-provided data, SAS necessitates robust location verification to counter identity and location spoofing attacks and remains a primary target for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Addressing these security challenges while adhering to regulatory requirements is essential. In this paper, we propose SLAP, a novel framework that ensures location privacy and anonymity during spectrum queries, usage notifications, and location-proof acquisition.

In this work, we study coupled scalar dark sector models inspired by ultraviolet-complete frameworks such as supergravity and string theory. These models involve scalar couplings arising either from their kinetic terms, through a non-trivial field space metric, or from their scalar potential. We demonstrate how these couplings can be elegantly formulated in terms of an interacting vector, a standard tool in coupled dark sector studies, and analyse their distinct cosmological effects using a dynamical systems approach. Using this framework, we further investigate an axio-dilaton system recently explored in the literature, where the dilaton also couples to baryons. Intriguingly, we show that certain kinetic and potential interactions may mimic one another or even cancel out, making them observationally indistinguishable. If such a distinction becomes possible through observational constraints, it could provide valuable insights into the underlying field space metric and its connection to fundamental physics.",Saba Rahimy,2025/3/3,2025/9/4,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'astro-ph.CO', 'gr-qc']"

Based on perturbative QCD, the branching ratio of the $ψ(3686)$ into some final hadron state should be approximately 13% of the branching ratio of the $J/ψ$ to that same hadron final state. This is called the ""13\% rule"". However, certain decay channels such as the $ρπ$ severely violate this 13% rule. Using the extended Linear Sigma Model, we study the effect a small mixing angle between the $ψ(3686)$ and the vector glueball can have on the 13% rule. We show that in a simple model the mixing can already suppress $ψ(3686)$ decays sufficiently to match the $ρπ$ observation, but to fully describe the data a more sophisticated model is necessary. We also show that matching to data can tell us about the magnitude of glueball decay widths.",Arthur Vereijken,2025/2/28,2025/2/28,,N/A,['hep-ph']

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the ""System 1"" way of quick reactions to the ""System 2"" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks.

It is thus natural to ask whether, in order to describe our experiments, the mathematical structure of complex Hilbert spaces it is built on is really necessary. Recently, it was shown that this structure is inevitable in network scenarios with independent sources. More precisely, Real Quantum Theory cannot explain the predictions of (Complex) Quantum Theory [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Here, we revisit the independence assumption underlying this work. We show that assuming partial independence is sufficient for showing the inadequacy of Real Quantum Theory. We derive a tradeoff between source independence and the Bell value achievable in Real Quantum Theory, which also lower bounds the source correlations required to explain previous experiments by means of real quantum systems. We further show that 1 bit of entanglement is necessary and sufficient for recovering the complex quantum correlations by means of Real Quantum Theory in the scenario from [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Finally, building on [McKague et al., PRL 102, 2009], we provide a construction to simulate any complex quantum setup with m independent sources by means of Real Quantum Theory, by allowing the sources to share a m real-qubit entangled state in the first round of the experiment.",Mirjam Weilenmann,2025/2/27,2025/11/21,,N/A,['quant-ph']

This renewed attention is driven by the recognition that current next-token prediction models often lack the ability for long-term planning. Is it possible to instill search-like abilities within the models to enhance their planning abilities without relying on explicit search? We propose DiffuSearch , a model that does \textit{implicit search} by looking into the future world via discrete diffusion modeling. We instantiate DiffuSearch on a classical board game, Chess, where explicit search is known to be essential. Through extensive controlled experiments, we show DiffuSearch outperforms both the searchless and explicit search-enhanced policies. Specifically, DiffuSearch outperforms the one-step policy by 19.2% and the MCTS-enhanced policy by 14% on action accuracy. Furthermore, DiffuSearch demonstrates a notable 30% enhancement in puzzle-solving abilities compared to explicit search-based policies, along with a significant 540 Elo increase in game-playing strength assessment. These results indicate that implicit search via discrete diffusion is a viable alternative to explicit search over a one-step policy.

In this work, we identify an apparent puzzle: a simple mathematical calculation predicts that on each problem, the failure rate should fall exponentially with the number of attempts. We confirm this prediction empirically, raising a question: from where does aggregate polynomial scaling emerge? We then answer this question by demonstrating per-problem exponential scaling can be made consistent with aggregate polynomial scaling if the distribution of single-attempt success probabilities is heavy tailed such that a small fraction of tasks with extremely low success probabilities collectively warp the aggregate success trend into a power law - even as each problem scales exponentially on its own. We further demonstrate that this distributional perspective explains previously observed deviations from power law scaling, and provides a simple method for forecasting the power law exponent with an order of magnitude lower relative error, or equivalently, ${\sim}2-4$ orders of magnitude less inference compute.

The robot was programmed to experience two types of failures -- executional and decisional -- occurring either at the beginning or end of the task, with or without acknowledgement of the failure. Our findings reveal that the type and timing of the robot's failure significantly affect participants' gaze behaviour and perception of the robot. Specifically, executional failures led to more gaze shifts and increased focus on the robot, while decisional failures resulted in lower entropy in gaze transitions among areas of interest, particularly when the failure occurred at the end of the task. These results highlight that gaze can serve as a reliable indicator of robot failures and their types, and could also be used to predict the appropriate recovery actions.",Ramtin Tabatabaei,2025/2/24,2025/2/24,,N/A,"['cs.RO', 'cs.HC']"

Maxfield-Turiaci proposed solving the negativity problem of pure 3d gravity by summing over off-shell geometries known as Seifert manifolds. We attempt to compute Seifert manifolds using Virasoro TQFT. Our results don't match completely with Maxfield-Turiaci. We trace the discrepancies to not including the mapping class group properly. We also compute a 3-boundary torus-wormhole by extrapolating from an on-shell geometry. We encounter challenges similar to those observed in the comparison between the genuine off-shell computation of a torus-wormhole by Cotler-Jensen and the extrapolation from an on-shell configuration.,Cynthia Yan,2025/2/23,2025/3/21,,N/A,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc']"
2502.16253v1,Making Puzzle Pieces Fit or Reshaping MiMiC for Multiscale Simulations with CP2K and More,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16253v1,"MiMiC is a framework for modeling large-scale chemical processes that require treatment at multiple resolutions. It does not aim to implement single-handedly all methods required to treat individual subsystems, but instead, it relegates this task to specialized computational chemistry software while it serves as an intermediary between these external programs, and computes the interactions between the subsystems. MiMiC minimizes issues typically associated with molecular dynamics performed with multiple programs, by adopting a multiple-program multiple-data paradigm combined with a loose-coupling model. In this article, we present the addition of a new client program, CP2K, to the MiMiC ecosystem, which required a major refactoring of the entire framework and in the end allowed us to unlock its full flexibility. By thorough timing analysis, we verify that the introduced changes do not affect the performance of MiMiC or CP2K, and neither are they a source of significant computational overheads that would be detrimental to simulation efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate the benefits of the framework's modular design, by performing a QM/MM MD simulation combining CP2K with previously interfaced OpenMM, with no additional implementation effort required.",Andrej Antalík,2025/2/22,2025/2/22,,N/A,"['physics.chem-ph', 'physics.comp-ph']"

Various methodologies, such as Rosenbluth separation and polarization transfer, are discussed, highlighting their evolution and challenges, including systematic uncertainties and theoretical ambiguities [arXiv:1706.00696].

At the face of it, this would seem to point towards a basic similarity between matter and dark matter, suggesting perhaps the widely discussed mirror world picture as an ideal setting for a discussion of this issue. Here we outline a new and simple mirror world scenario to explain this puzzle. Our model uses Affleck-Dine mechanism to generate baryon asymmetry and dark matter relic density leading to an asymmetric dark matter picture. We find that for a certain parameter range of the model, the mirror electron is the unique possibility for dark matter whereas in the complementary parameter range, the mirror baryons constitute the dark matter. In either case, the mirror photon must have mass in the MeV range for consistency with observations.

They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields.

Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z > 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr > 2 Å) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (> 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$γ$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 $M_{\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk.

At sufficient densities, the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called ``hyperon puzzle'', so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons for neutron star properties has remained elusive. Starting from the newly developed auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate hyper-neutron matter (HNM) without any sign oscillations, we derive three distinct EoSs by employing the state-of-the-art Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory. We include $NΛ$, $ΛΛ$ two-body forces, $NNΛ$, and $NΛΛ$ three-body forces. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the neutron star mass, radius, tidal deformability, and the universal $I$-Love-$Q$ relation. The maximum mass, radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star are predicted to be $2.17(1)(1)~M_\odot$, $R_{1.4M\odot}=13.10(1)(7)~$km, and $Λ_{1.4M_\odot}=597(5)(18)$, respectively, based on our most realistic EoS. These predictions are in good agreement with the latest astrophysical constraints derived from observations of massive neutron stars, gravitational waves, and joint mass-radius measurements. Also, for the first time in \textit{ab initio} calculations, we investigate both non-rotating and rotating neutron star configurations. The results indicate that the impact of rotational dynamics on the maximum mass is small, regardless of whether hyperons are present in the EoS or not.",Hui Tong,2025/2/20,2025/2/20,,N/A,['nucl-th']

The question that naturally arises is to what extent this observation can be attributed to the unbound character of the $2^+_1$ state. To understand the influence of the continuum space on the low-energy properties of $^{36}$Ca, we carried out Gamow shell model calculations that can account for the continuum coupling effects associated with the occupation of unbound $fp$ shells.

Existing global approaches, which optimize all potential fragment pairs simultaneously or data-driven models, are prone to local minima and face scalability issues when multiple pots are intermixed. Motivated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for 3D reconstruction from multiple images, we propose an efficient reassembly method for axially symmetric pots based on iterative registration of one sherd at a time, called Structure-from-Sherds++ (SfS++). Our method extends beyond simple replication of incremental SfM and leverages multi-graph beam search to explore multiple registration paths. This allows us to effectively filter out indistinguishable false matches and simultaneously reconstruct multiple pots without requiring prior information such as base or the number of mixed objects. Our approach achieves 87% reassembly accuracy on a dataset of 142 real fragments from 10 different pots, outperforming other methods in handling complex fracture patterns with mixed datasets and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

As a consequence, for typical metal in near-field heat transfer, the Coulomb interaction goes as $1/d^4$ with the distance of the vacuum gap instead of the well-known $1/d^2$ of Drude model result. The current response $Π$ is shown to be highly anisotropic.

The puzzle's difficulty is set by the difficulty adjustment mechanism (DAM), based on the network's available mining power. Attacks that destroy some portion of mining power can exploit the DAM to lower difficulty, making such attacks profitable. In this paper, we analyze three types of mining power destruction attacks in the presence of petty-compliant mining pools: selfish mining, bribery, and mining power distraction attacks. We analyze selfish mining while accounting for the distribution of mining power among pools, a factor often overlooked in the literature. Our findings indicate that selfish mining can be more destructive when the non-adversarial mining share is well distributed among pools. We also introduce a novel bribery attack, where the adversarial pool bribes petty-compliant pools to orphan others' blocks. For small pools, we demonstrate that the bribery attack can dominate strategies like selfish mining or undercutting. Lastly, we present the mining distraction attack, where the adversarial pool incentivizes petty-compliant pools to abandon Bitcoin's puzzle and mine for a simpler puzzle, thus wasting some part of their mining power. Similar to the previous attacks, this attack can lower the mining difficulty, but with the difference that it does not generate any evidence of mining power destruction, such as orphan blocks.",Roozbeh Sarenche,2025/2/11,2025/2/11,,N/A,['cs.CR']

Here, we investigate the transition metal oxide spinel LiV2O4, an enigmatic heavy fermion compound lacking localized f orbital states. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical mean field theory to reveal a new kind of correlation-induced flat band with suppressed inter-atomic electron hopping arising from intra-atomic Hund coupling. The appearance of heavy quasiparticles is ascribed to a proximate orbital-selective Mott state characterized by fluctuating local moments as evidenced by complementary magnetotransport measurements. The spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived quasiparticles and their disappearance with increasing temperature further support the emergence of a high-temperature bad metal state observed in transport data. This work resolves a long-standing puzzle on the origin of heavy fermion behavior and unconventional transport in LiV2O4.

On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.",Jaeyeon Kim,2025/2/10,2025/8/19,,N/A,['cs.LG']

Additionally, the use of optical lattices facilitates the realization of `lattice-supersolids', which paves the way to study the effect of correlations in a controlled manner. A brief theoretical framework is presented to characterize this puzzling state with competing orders and to gain insight into its basic properties.

We generalize the setting by allowing the states of vertices to be the elements of a group $G$, where a \textit{click} in vertex $v$ multiplies the state of $v$ and its neighbors by an element $g \in G$ on the right.  Starting with the identity element $e \in G$ for all vertices, the totality of all achievable state configurations forms a group $G^Γ$. This group generalizes parallel products of group actions and provides a rich structure for analysis. For many graphs, which we term ``RA'' (reducible to abelian), the problem reduces -- regardless of $G$ -- to a linear algebra question over $\mathbb{Z}$. We discuss a chain of five different subgroups consisting of commutators and introduce techniques for showing that families of graphs are RA using each. In particular, using Heisenberg groups, we establish that a graph is RA precisely when a certain lattice spans $\mathbb{Z}^{|Γ|}$. While most graphs appear to be RA, we show the odd-dimensional cube graphs $Q_{2n+1}$ and folded cube graphs $\square_d$, for $d$ odd or 2, are not.",Gabe Cunningham,2025/2/8,2025/10/27,,N/A,"['math.GR', 'math.CO']"

The existence of a Nube-like galaxy in IllustrisTNG,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04833v1,"The recent discovery of the most extended ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG), Nube, has raised yet another question about the validity of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. The studies using cosmological and zoom-in simulations, which assume CDM, failed to replicate galaxies with the structural properties of Nube. However, the simulation box or the examined population of UDGs may be too narrow to fully capture the range of effects that can lead to the formation of such extraordinary galaxies. In this work we present a case study of a Nube-like galaxy from TNG100, the most extended simulated UDG examined to date that closely mirrors the structural properties of the observed Nube galaxy. Since its formation, the simulated Nube-like galaxy has already been ultra-diffuse and evolved mainly in isolated regions with occasional interactions. Its last major merger was finalized about 1.336 Gyr ago and left no trace of interaction apart from further extending the stellar size. This evolutionary pathway, featuring a recent merger that expanded an already ultra-diffuse stellar system, is unique and innovative compared to previous studies. We argue that multiple proposed formation mechanisms can operate simultaneously, further expanding the UDGs and making them extreme outliers of the mass-size relation under favorable conditions. Therefore, it is essential to study these simulated extreme outliers, their formation, and, more importantly, their evolution. We also highlight the necessity of carefully analyzing and interpreting the simulated data and better understanding the limitations of a chosen simulation. Thus, if Nube is considered an extreme outlier, its properties are not in tension with the standard cosmological model.",Nataša Pavlov,2025/2/7,2025/2/7,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']

While it is known that frustration in soft matter assemblies has the ability to propagate up to mesoscopic, multi-particle size scales, notably through the selection of self-limiting domain, little is understood about how the symmetry of shape-misfit at the particle scale influences emergent morphologies at the mesoscale. Here we show that polarity in the shape-misfit of warped-jigsaw puzzles manifests at a larger scale in the morphology and thermodynamics of the ground-state assembly of self-limiting domains. We use a combination of continuum theory and discrete particle simulations to show that the polar misfit gives rise to two mesoscopically distinct polar, self-limiting ribbon domains. Thermodynamic selection between the two ribbon morphologies is controlled by a combination of the binding anisotropy along distinct neighbor directions and the orientation of polar shape-misfit. These predictions are valuable as design features for ongoing efforts to program self-limiting assemblies through the synthesis of intentionally frustrated particles, and further suggests a generic classification of frustrated assembly behavior in terms of the relative symmetries of shape-misfit and the underlying long-range inter-particle order it frustrates.",Michael Wang,2025/2/7,2025/2/7,,N/A,"['cond-mat.soft', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci']"

Determining if a system exhibits agency is a notoriously difficult question: Dennett (1989), for instance, highlights the puzzle of determining which principles can decide whether a rock, a thermostat, or a robot each possess agency. We here address this puzzle from the viewpoint of reinforcement learning by arguing that agency is fundamentally frame-dependent: Any measurement of a system's agency must be made relative to a reference frame. We support this claim by presenting a philosophical argument that each of the essential properties of agency proposed by Barandiaran et al. (2009) and Moreno (2018) are themselves frame-dependent.

Thus, they allow to evaluate performance on previously unseen, larger and more difficult puzzles that follow the same underlying rules. Since traditional approaches often struggle to represent such scalable logical structures, we propose to model these puzzles using a graph-based approach. Then, we investigate the key factors enabling the proposed models to learn generalizable solutions in a reinforcement learning setting. Our study focuses on the impact of the inductive bias of the architecture, different reward systems and the role of recurrent modeling in enabling sequential reasoning.

These dimensions translate into guidance about which data type, statistical measure and testing strategy should be used. To perform such test suitable statistical models are needed which we implement as a hierarchical hedonic price model and a complementary count model. These models are amended by regime and contextual variables as suggested by our classification strategy. We apply this framework to the Austrian real estate market together with three disruptive events triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, a policy tightening mortgage lending standards, as well as the cost-of-living crisis that came along with increased financing costs. The tests yield the expected results and, by that, some housing market puzzles are resolved. Deviating from the prior classification exercise means that some developments would have been undetected.

Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5.

Nevertheless, the mechanism of QPO modulation in NS systems, where the amplitudes of QPOs with frequencies approaching kHz range are very high in comparison to BH high-frequency QPOs, remains an unsolved puzzle. Relativistic ray tracing of photons emitted from the immediate vicinity of compact objects has, to date, been used to investigate various mechanisms that explain the observed weak BH QPOs. However, it has not been applied to model the NS QPO signal, which requires incorporating the NS surface and a bright boundary layer (BL) on it. Here, we explore the QPO modulation mechanisms based on the BL obscuration. Using simplified models of axisymmetric oscillations of thick accretion discs (tori), we demonstrate that the disc oscillations drive the high NS QPO amplitudes through BL obscuration, which is relevant especially for vertical oscillations. We also demonstrate that obscuration effects enable the observability of the Keplerian frequency in the case of discs that decay due to instabilities.",Gabriel Török,2025/2/4,2025/2/11,,N/A,['astro-ph.HE']

Various models of stationary regular black holes globally satisfy the null convergence condition (NCC). At first glance this might seem puzzling, as the NCC must generically be violated to avoid the focusing point implied by the Penrose theorem. In fact, the Penrose singularity theorem depends on subtle global assumptions and does not provide information about where and when the singularity actually forms. In particular inner horizons are typically reached at finite affine parameter, before null geodesic focusing occurs, and the region inside the inner horizon is not itself a trapped region. Specifically, the Bardeen, Dymnikova, Hayward models of stationary regular black holes feature an inner Cauchy horizon which violates global hyperbolicity, hence violating one of the key assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem, and furthermore challenging their viability as long-living end-points of gravitational collapse. In contrast, during non-stationary processes describing kinematic transitions between standard singular black holes and regular black holes or horizonless compact objects, the inner horizon -- when present -- need not act as a Cauchy horizon. This raises the intriguing possibility that the NCC might instead be violated during intermediate stages of such transitions. Our detailed analysis confirms that NCC violations occur frequently during such kinematic transitions, even when the stationary end-point spacetimes respect the NCC. We also investigate analogous transitions toward black-bounce spacetimes and their horizonless compact counterparts, wormholes, where the NCC is always violated.

2501.17681v2,Self-consistent analysis for the $η_c\rightarrow γγ$ process,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17681v2,"The next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) pQCD predictions for both the decay width and the transition form factor in the $η_c\rightarrow γγ$ process, based on nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), deviate from precise experimental measurements. These significant discrepancies have cast doubt on the applicability of NRQCD to charmonium processes. In this paper, we analyze the $η_c\rightarrow γγ$ process by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), a systematic method for eliminating renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities. The PMC renormalization scales are determined by absorbing the non-conformal $β$ terms which govern the behavior of the QCD running coupling via the Renormalization Group Equation. We obtain the PMC scale $Q_\star=4.49\,m_c$ for the $η_c\rightarrow γγ$ decay width. Even after using the PMC method, the convergence of the pQCD series is still poor, which indicates the importance of uncalculated NNNLO and higher-order terms. The resulting value for $Γ_{η_c\rightarrow γγ}$ is in agreement with the Particle Data Group's reported value of $Γ_{η_c\rightarrow γγ}=5.1\pm0.4$ keV within the bounds of uncertainties. Moreover, the transition form factor obtained using the PMC is also in good agreement with precise experimental measurements. The application of the PMC suggests a potential resolution to $η_c\rightarrow γγ$ puzzle and supports the applicability of NRQCD to charmonium processes.",Sheng-Quan Wang,2025/1/29,2025/6/3,,N/A,"['hep-ph', 'hep-ex']"

The method accomplishes this by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guided by a step-level value model that rewards moderate surprisal (curiosity) while penalizing incoherence, and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to fine-tune the policy on high-value plot expansions. This iterative reinforcement learning loop systematically explores multiple candidate plot branches, backpropagates quality signals, and adapts the policy for faster convergence, notably shifting the policy from puzzle-based Chain-of-Thought to more character-driven storytelling. In small-scale tests with short-story prompts, 67%-77% of participants favored COS(M+O)S's highest-rated expansions over lower-rated ones, suggesting that our learned value function aligns. GPT-4o ratings further show that COS(M+O)S surpasses naive single-pass decoding from Llama 3.2 3B by 0.59 SD, coming within 0.06 SD of Llama 3.1 70B (no significant difference, p=0.93).

However, most existing methods rely on single-modal data sharing, limiting fusion performance, particularly in heterogeneous sensor settings involving both LiDAR and cameras across vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To address this, we propose Radian Glue Attention (RG-Attn), a lightweight and generalizable cross-modal fusion module that unifies intra-agent and inter-agent fusion via transformation-based coordinate alignment and a unified sampling/inversion strategy. RG-Attn efficiently aligns features through a radian-based attention constraint, operating column-wise on geometrically consistent regions to reduce overhead and preserve spatial coherence, thereby enabling accurate and robust fusion. Building upon RG-Attn, we propose three cooperative architectures. The first, Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP), prioritizes communication efficiency but assumes all agents have LiDAR, optionally paired with cameras. The second, Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), offers maximal flexibility, supporting any sensor setup (e.g., LiDAR-only, camera-only, or both) and enabling strong cross-modal generalization for real-world deployment. The third, Pyramid-RG-Attn Fusion (PRGAF), aims for peak detection accuracy with the highest computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show our framework delivers state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high flexibility and efficiency.

Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry.

We discuss flavour non-universal gauge interactions as a possible origin for $U(2)$-like flavour symmetries which, in addition to allowing new physics to be lighter, opens up a simultaneous low-scale solution to the flavour puzzle.

In this work, we use samples with various atomic orientations to capture this polycrystalline nature. We thoroughly investigate their SOT-induced spin dynamics and demonstrate that the polycrystalline structure leads to distinct outcomes. Our findings reveal that configuration II, where the Kagome plane is perpendicular to the spin polarization, exhibits robust switching with stable polarity, whereas the signals from various sub-configurations in configuration I cancel each other out. By comparing our findings with experimental results, we pinpoint the primary sources contributing to the measured AHE signals. Additionally, we establish a dynamic balance model that incorporates the unique properties of Mn3Sn to elucidate these observations.

Here $S(π,π)$, $χ_s$, $c$, $ξ,$ and $T$ are the staggered structure factor, the staggered susceptibility, the spin-wave velocity, the correlation length, and the temperature, respectively. For other QCR universal quantities, such as the Wilson ratio $W$ and $χ_u c^2/T$ ($χ_u$ is the uniform susceptibility), it is shown that the addition of higher order theoretical contribution makes the agreement between the numerical and the analytic results worse. We find that the same scenario applies to $S(π,π)/\left(χ_s T\right)$ and $c/\left(Tξ\right)$ as well. Specifically, our calculations lead to $S(π,π)/\left(χ_s T\right)\sim 1.073$ and $c/\left(Tξ\right)\sim 0.963$ which are in better consistence with the leading theoretical predictions than those with the next-to-leading order terms.

This appears particularly interesting in view of the recent results found by the DESI Collaboration, suggesting that a dynamical dark energy scenario seems to be favored than a genuine cosmological constant. Accordingly, we take into account possible violations by considering four different parameterizations, namely: a Taylor expansion around $z\simeq 0$, a slightly-departing logarithmic correction, a (1;2) Padé rational series to heal the convergence problem and a Chebyshev polynomial expansion, reducing \emph{de facto} the systematic errors associated with the analysis. We test each of them in a model-independent (-dependent) way, by working out Monte-Carlo Markov chain analyses, employing the Bézier interpolation of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ for the model-independent approach while assuming the flat (non-flat) $Λ$CDM and $ω_0ω_1$CDM models, motivating the latter paradigm in view of the DESI findings. Subsequently, we explore two analyses, employing observational Hubble data, galaxy clusters from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and type Ia supernovae, investigating the impact of the DESI data catalog, first including then excluding the entire data set. Afterwards, we adopt statistical model selection criteria to assess the statistically favored cosmological model. Our results suggest \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality. While a slight spatial curvature cannot be entirely excluded, the preferred cosmological model remains the flat $Λ$CDM background, even when incorporating DESI data.

Hanano and Jelly-No are one-player, 2D side-view puzzle games with a dynamic board consisting of coloured, movable blocks disposed on platforms. These blocks can be moved by the player and are subject to gravity. Both games somehow vary in their gameplay, but the goal is always to move the coloured blocks in order to reach a specific configuration and make them interact with each other or with other elements of the game. In Jelly-No the goal is to merge all coloured blocks of a same colour, which also happens when they make contact. In Hanano the goal is to make all the coloured blocks bloom by making contact with flowers of the same colour. Jelly-No was proven by Chao Yang to be NP-Complete under the restriction that all movable blocks are the same colour and NP-Hard for more colours. Hanano was proven by Michael C. Chavrimootoo to be PSPACE-Complete under the restriction that all movable blocks are the same colour. However, the question whether Jelly-No for more than one colours is also PSPACE-complete or if it too stays in NP was left open. In this paper, we settle this question, proving that Jelly-No is PSPACE-Complete with an unbounded number of colours. We further show that, if we allow black jellies (that is, jellies that do not need to be merged), the game is PSPACE-complete even for one colour.

Here the glass transition thermodynamics for 150 different glass-forming systems are studied statistically. It is found that the activation characters in the energy landscape are crucial to precisely portray the glass transition and, in particular, both the activation free energy (G*) and the activation entropy (S*) play critical roles. G* determines Tg, Tg=G*/290+25.5, while S* determines m, m=S*/Rln10+15 with R is gas constant.

A cantilever glued with a gold sphere is used to measured the force acting on the gold sphere by the spin source. The spin source is driven to oscillate, and then the imaginary part of the signal is extracted at the 10th harmonic of the oscillation frequency, which effectively separates the exotic interaction from the spurious forces commonly present in such short-range measurements.

In systems using (3), rather than directly accessing the shared resources upon arrival, a customer is considerate and waits to access them until nearby users in service have left. This new model can be seen as a missing piece of a larger puzzle that contains such dynamics as spatial birth-and-death processes, the Poisson-Hail model, and wireless dynamics as key other pieces. It is shown that, under natural assumptions, this model can be represented as a Markov process on the space of counting measures. The main results are then two-fold. The first is on the shape of the stability region and, more precisely, on the characterization of the critical value of the arrival rate that separates stability from instability. The second is of a more qualitative or perhaps even ethical nature.

We focus on the trade-off between finding a solution and verifying it, highlighting how understanding the structure of the solution space can inform the complexity of these problems. By examining the relationship between the number of possible configurations and the time complexity required to traverse this space we demonstrate that the minimal time to verify a solution is often smaller than the time required to discover it. Our results suggest that the efficiency of solving $\textbf{NP}$-complete problems is not only determined by the ability to find solutions but also by how effectively we can navigate and characterize the solution space. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on computational complexity, particularly in understanding the interplay between solution space size, algorithm design, and the inherent challenges of finding versus verifying solutions.",Roy Burson,2025/1/17,2025/1/17,,N/A,['math.GM']

It is found that model calculations with such a $Λ$ potential can reproduce the data of the $Λ$ hypernuclear spectroscopy and the $Λ$ directed flow in heavy-ion collisions. Also, we evaluate the $Σ$ potential, which can be calculated by using the same hyperon forces as for the $Λ$ potential.

In this study, we propose that these sources are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate the critical roles of photon scattering, reflections, and shadowing within funnel-like structures along the disk's rotation axis. Our models predict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent luminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and significant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to shadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and pronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction factors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed coronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain the observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing angle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the broad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can naturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and provide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.",Piero Madau,2025/1/16,2025/1/16,,N/A,"['astro-ph.HE', 'astro-ph.GA']"

The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and may allow a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. We focus on the $iφ^3$ cubic scalar theory, obtaining the relevant pseudo-reality conditions up to quadratic order in the coupling; a theory of two complex scalar fields with non-Hermitian mass mixing; and the latter's coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field.

They formed and quenched within two billion years and simulations routinely struggle to predict their observed abundances. Developing a robust identification technique for these galaxies is crucial for constraining galaxy evolution models. Traditional rest-frame color-color selection techniques for quiescent galaxies are known to break down or require adjustments at $z\gtrsim3$. Recently, observed-frame color-color criteria have been established with JWST/NIRCam colors that efficiently pre-select high-redshift quiescent galaxies using only $\lesssim1\%$ of a given sample. In this work, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection machine-learning technique is applied to pre-select quiescent galaxies over $3<z<6$ using observed NIRCam colors. From a parent sample of 43,926 galaxies in JADES, we ultimately find 44 quiescent candidates from a pool of $\approx2,300$ galaxies. This is about five times fewer galaxies than what would be pre-selected using color-color criteria. Two-thirds of these candidates can be pre-selected from a pool as small as 247, which is about twice as efficient as existing observed-frame color selection techniques. Nearly two-thirds of the candidates are new discoveries and include quiescent galaxies with mass-weighted ages as young as $\lesssim300$ Myr. We obtain number densities in agreement with the literature at $z<4$ and find generally higher abundances at $z>4$, although our measurements are consistent within errors.

The collectivity has been observed for various particle and beam species, in particular, in collision of small systems. Experimental results obtained for discrete symmetries of strong interaction at finite temperature confirm indirectly the topologically non-trivial structure of the vacuum. The recent measurements of femtoscopic correlations provide, in particular, the indirect estimations for parameters of hyperon-nucleon potentials which are essential for study of inner structure of compact astrophysical objects. Novel mechanism for multiparticle production due to collectivity can be expected in very high energy nuclear collisions and it may be helpful for better understanding of the nature of the muon puzzle in ultra-high energy cosmic ray measurements.

Here, we present a statistical study of dust formation in 40 novae with high-quality optical/IR light curves, quantitatively distinguishing dust-forming from non-dust-forming novae while exploring the properties of the dust events. We find that 50-70% of novae produce dust, significantly higher than previous estimates. Dust-forming novae can be separated from those that do not show dust formation by using the largest redward ($V-K$) colour change from peak visible brightness; ($V-J$) or ($V-H$) offer useful but less sensitive constraints. This makes optical+IR photometry a powerful tool to quantify dust formation in novae. We find that novae detected in GeV $γ$-rays by \emph{Fermi}-LAT appear to form dust more often than novae not detected by \emph{Fermi}, implying a possible connection between $γ$-ray producing shocks and dust production. We also find that novae that evolve very quickly ($t_2 < 10$ days) are much less likely to form dust, in agreement with previous findings. We confirm a correlation between $t_2$ and the time of the onset of dust formation (which occurs $\sim$1 week--3 months after maximum light), but conclude that it is primarily an observational artifact driven by dust formation determining when a nova drops 2 mag below peak.

Detecting quenched, isolated dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids indicates that environmental factors are not the sole drivers of their quenching. Internal mechanisms, such as feedback from in-situ star formation, also contributing to the NSC formation, black holes, or variations in conditions during their formation, offer potential explanations for star formation suppression in these galaxies. These findings highlight the need for a significant revision in our understanding of baryonic physics, particularly concerning the formation and evolution of low-mass galaxies.",Bahar Bidaran,2025/1/6,2025/1/6,,N/A,['astro-ph.GA']
2501.02632v2,The gravitational path integral from an observer's point of view,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02632v2,"One of the fundamental problems in quantum gravity is to describe the experience of a gravitating observer in generic spacetimes. In this paper, we develop a framework for describing non-perturbative physics relative to an observer using the gravitational path integral. We apply our proposal to an observer that lives in a closed universe and one that falls behind a black hole horizon. We find that the Hilbert space that describes the experience of the observer is much larger than the Hilbert space in the absence of an observer. In the case of closed universes, the Hilbert space is not one-dimensional, as calculations in the absence of the observer suggest. Rather, its dimension scales exponentially with $G_N^{-1}$. Similarly, from an observer's perspective, the dimension of the Hilbert space in a two-sided black hole is increased. We compute various observables probing the experience of a gravitating observer in this Hilbert space. We find that an observer experiences non-trivial physics in the closed universe in contrast to what it would see in a one-dimensional Hilbert space. In the two-sided black hole setting, our proposal implies that non-perturbative corrections to effective field theory for an infalling observer are suppressed until times exponential in the black hole entropy, resolving a recently raised puzzle in black hole physics. While the framework that we develop is exemplified in the toy-model of JT gravity, most of our analysis can be extended to higher dimensions and, in particular, to generic spacetimes not admitting a conventional holographic description, such as cosmological universes or black hole interiors.",Ahmed I.

2501.01947v1,A uniform action of the dihedral group $ Z_2\times D_3$ on Littlewood--Richardson coefficients,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01947v1,"We show that the dihedral group $ Z_2\times D_3$ of order twelve acts faithfully on the set LR, either consisting of Littlewood-Richardson tableaux, or their companion tableaux, or Knutson-Tao hives or Knutson-Tao-Woodward puzzles,via involutions which simultaneously conjugate or shuffle a Littlewood-Richardson triple of partitions. The action of $ Z_2\times D_3$ carries a linear time index two subgroup $H\simeq D_3$ action, where an involution which goes from $H$ into the other coset of H is difficult in the sense that it is not manifest neither exhibited by simple means. Pak and Vallejo have earlier made this observation with respect to the subgroup of index two in the symmetric group $ S_3$ consisting of cyclic permutations which H extends. The other half LR symmetries, not in the range of the H-action, are hidden and consist of commutativity and conjugation symmetries. Their exhibition is reduced to the action of a remaining generator of $ Z_2\times D_3$, which belongs to the other coset of H, and enables to reduce in linear time all known LR commuters and transposers to each other, and to the Luzstig- Schützenberger involution. A hive is specified by superimposing the companion tableau pair of an LR tableau, and its $Z_2\times D_3$-symmetries are exhibited via the corresponding LR companion tableau pair. The action of $ Z_2\times D_3$ on puzzles, naturally in bijection with Purbhoo mosaics, is consistent with the migration map on mosaics which translates to jeu de taquin slides or tableau-switching on LR tableaux. Their H-symmetries are reduced to simple procedures on a puzzle via label swapping together with simple reflections of an equilateral triangle, that is, puzzle dualities, and rotations on an equilateral triangle.",Olga Azenhas,2025/1/3,2025/1/3,,N/A,['math.CO']
2501.03258v1,How Can a Quantum Particle Be Found in a Classically Forbidden Region?,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03258v1,"Among the many perplexing results of quantum mechanics is one that contradicts a result from introductory physics: the possibility of finding a quantum particle in a region that would be forbidden classically by energy conservation. An especially interesting example of this phenomenon with practical applications is quantum tunneling. Here we investigate the reasons for this puzzling result by focusing on the difference between how quantities like kinetic and potential energy are represented mathematically in classical and quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, physical observables, like energy, are represented by operators rather than real numbers. The consequences of this difference will be illustrated explicitly using a toy model in which the kinetic and potential energy operators are represented by $2 \times 2$ matrices, which do not commute like their classical analogs. This model will then illustrate how classically perplexing results, like a quantum particle being found in the forbidden region, can arise.",Dennis E.

2501.00226v2,Generative Emergent Communication: Large Language Model is a Collective World Model,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00226v2,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.",Tadahiro Taniguchi,2024/12/31,2025/7/16,,N/A,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL']"

We refer to this limiting theory as ``tantum gravity'' and describe in this Letter some of its main properties and prospects for physics.

2412.20836v1,Diprotodon on the sky. The Large Galactic Supernova Remnant (SNR) G278.94+1.35,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20836v1,"We present a re-discovery of G278.94+1.35 as possibly one of the largest known Galactic supernova remnants (SNR) - that we name Diprotodon. While previously established as a Galactic SNR, Diprotodon is visible in our new EMU and GLEAM radio continuum images at an angular size of 3.33x3.23 deg, much larger than previously measured. At the previously suggested distance of 2.7 kpc, this implies a diameter of 157x152 pc. This size would qualify Diprotodon as the largest known SNR and pushes our estimates of SNR sizes to the upper limits. We investigate the environment in which the SNR is located and examine various scenarios that might explain such a large and relatively bright SNR appearance. We find that Diprotodon is most likely at a much closer distance of $\sim$1 kpc, implying its diameter is 58x56 pc and it is in the radiative evolutionary phase. We also present a new Fermi-LAT data analysis that confirms the angular extent of the SNR in gamma-rays. The origin of the high-energy emission remains somewhat puzzling, and the scenarios we explore reveal new puzzles, given this unexpected and unique observation of a seemingly evolved SNR having a hard GeV spectrum with no breaks. We explore both leptonic and hadronic scenarios, as well as the possibility that the high-energy emission arises from the leftover particle population of a historic pulsar wind nebula.",Miroslav D.

2501.00065v1,Predicting Preschoolers' Externalizing Problems with Mother-Child Interaction Dynamics and Deep Learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00065v1,"Objective: Predicting children's future levels of externalizing problems helps to identify children at risk and guide targeted prevention. Existing studies have shown that mothers providing support in response to children's dysregulation was associated with children's lower levels of externalizing problems. The current study aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy of predicting children's externalizing problems with mother-child interaction dynamics. Method: This study used mother-child interaction dynamics during a challenging puzzle task to predict children's externalizing problems six months later (N=101, 46 boys, Mage=57.41 months, SD=6.58). Performance of the Residual Dynamic Structural Equation Model (RDSEM) was compared with the Attention-based Sequential Behavior Interaction Modeling (ASBIM) model, developed using the deep learning techniques. Results: The RDSEM revealed that children whose mothers provided more autonomy support after increases of child defeat had lower levels of externalizing problems. Five-fold cross-validation showed that the RDSEM had good prediction accuracy. The ASBIM model further improved prediction accuracy, especially after including child inhibitory control as a personalized individual feature. Conclusions: The dynamic process of mother-child interaction provides important information for predicting children's externalizing problems, especially maternal autonomy supportive response to child defeat. The deep learning model is a useful tool to further improve prediction accuracy.",Xi Chen,2024/12/29,2024/12/29,,N/A,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']"

We provide non-trivial evidence for the existence of such string stars in spacetime dimensions $d\geq 7$ as higher-dimensional counterparts of HP solutions. In particular, we explicitly construct string star solutions in $d=7$ that are under perturbative control. In $d>7$, at the Hagedorn temperature, we identify these string stars as a specific normalizable representative of a new one-parameter bounded family of Euclidean solutions which can be under perturbative control. The higher-order $α'$ corrections play a crucial role in our arguments and, as pointed by other works, nullify the previous arguments against the existence of string stars in $d\geq 7$. The higher-dimensional string stars have non-zero free energy at Hagedorn temperature and their mass and free energy are of the same order as those of a string-sized black hole. In $d>7$, these solutions are string sized, but in $d=7$, the size of these solutions diverges as $\sim (T_{\rm H}-T)^{-1/4}$ near the Hagedorn temperature.",Alek Bedroya,2024/12/27,2025/7/25,,N/A,['hep-th']

To resolve this puzzle, we conducted an experiment using a pulsed cold neutron beam at J-PARC. In this experiment, the neutron lifetime is determined from the ratio of neutron decay counts to $^3$He(n,p)$^3$H reactions in a gas detector. This experiment belongs to the beam method but differs from previous experiments that measured protons, as it instead detects electrons, enabling measurements with distinct systematic uncertainties. By enlarging the beam transport system and reducing systematic uncertainties, we achieved a fivefold improvement in precision. Analysis of all acquired data yielded a neutron lifetime of $τ_{\rm n}=877.2~\pm~1.7_{\rm(stat.)}~^{+4.0}_{-3.6}{}_{\rm (sys.)}$ s.

It emits pulsed X-rays with a very soft spectrum, powered by accretion from the tenuous stellar wind of its companion of sdO spectral type. The current level of mass accretion cannot provide enough angular momentum to explain the small, but precisely measured, spin-up rate of 72 nanoseconds per year, which is instead best interpreted as the result of the radial contraction of this young white dwarf.

A proper treatment of the effects produced by magnetic fields during the dynamical evolution of these systems, can help to understand observables that otherwise show a puzzling behavior. Furthermore, when these fields are comparable to or stronger than Λ_QCD, they serve as excellent probes to help elucidate the physics of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and density.

Here, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Se K-edge sheds light on the impact of carrier-doping on the local structure of the high-$T_c$ (~39 K) $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ phase. This material is derived by annealing the structurally related as-made derivative ($T_c$~ 44 K), with layers being primed apart by [alkali-molecule] guests. Metrics, such as, a reduced filling of Se $4p$ orbitals and shorter Fe-Se bonds in the annealed phase, corroborate to a lower electron doping level with respect to the as-made one. Analysis of the metal-ligand thermal motion, based on the correlated Debye model, further relates the higher $T_c$ intercalates with the softening of the local Fe-Se bond. Beyond electronic effects, intercalation brings forth host-guest interactions that mediate the dynamics of the bulk crystal structure. For this, neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy on the annealed derivative, corroborates to the Se-Fe-Se layer being sensitive to chemical pressure effects imposed by the confined organic guests. This reflects in the phonon density of states, where harder low-energy transverse acoustic matrix phonons and molecular vibrations are witnessed, with respect to the pristine inorganic ($β$-FeSe) and organic ($C_5D_5N$) counterparts. On cooling through $T_c$, these excitations arrive without a collective magnetic-resonance mode - essential in unconventional, spin-mediated mechanisms - enquiring about deviations from optimal doping. The work highlights that when the Fe-square planes are tuned far apart, carrier-doping leveraged by intercalation plays a key role in the $T_c$ parametrization.",Alexandros Deltsidis,2024/12/20,2024/12/20,,N/A,"['cond-mat.supr-con', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.str-el']"
